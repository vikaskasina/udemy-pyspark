Thank u Karan Paulson\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Opaque spot on chest x-ray is commonly due to lung infection like pneumonia or tuberculosis and lung cancer. Since patient is young, no need to worry about lung cancer. He is also having recent history of upper respiratory tract infection (URI). This can cause pneumonia in some pediatric patients. So opaque spot is mostly due to pneumonia. And this is why doctor has given antibiotics and ask four repeat chest x-ray after 3 weeks to see improvement in chest x-ray. So give your son antibiotics as per doctor s advice and get done chest x-ray after 3 weeks. Don't worry, he will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

This helps them evade the immune system and enables them to cause recurrent infections. Rhinovirus binds to ICAM-1 receptors on epithelial cells and makes them release inflammatory cytokines, but does not cause damage to them. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) does not cause any release of cytokines. Instead, it replicates in the nose and pharynx. In many occasions, it can spread to the lower respiratory tract.  Human parainfluenza virus causes inflammation of the respiratory tract, so parainfluenza infection is much more severe than other viruses. The body fights the offending viruses using both humoral immunity (i.e. IgA in the epithelium), and cell mediated immunity (i.e. different inflammatory cells in the adenoids and tonsils).  Normal flora inhabitants in the nasopharynx also play an important role in eliminating the infection."}

Headache with double vision is not always due to cancer but a cancer or benign brain tumor might cause these symptoms. Since the symptoms are reducing therefore it is unlikely that you have a cancer.

The patient lies on the X-ray table and a preliminary X-ray is taken. The patient is then asked to lie on the side while a well lubricated enema tube is inserted into the rectum. As the enema enters the body, the patient might have the sensation that their stomach is being filled. The barium, a radiopaque (shows up on X-ray) contrast medium, is then allowed to flow into the colon. A small balloon at the tip of the enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium inside. The flow of the barium is monitored by the health care provider on an X-ray fluoroscope screen (like a TV monitor). Air may be puffed into the colon to distend it and provide better images (often called a \"double-contrast\" exam). If air is used, the enema tube will be reinserted (if it had been removed; whether it is depends on who does the exam) and a small amount of air will be introduced into the colon, and more X-ray pictures are taken.\nThe patient is usually asked to move to different positions and the table is slightly tipped to get different views.\nIf there is a suspected bowel perforation, a water-soluble contrast is used instead of barium. The study is otherwise very similar, although the images are not quite as good. (The concern with existing perforation is that contrast will leak from the bowel to the peritoneal cavity, and water-soluble material is safer than barium, which must be removed.)"}

Also, protect children from an early age. Doctors suggest that people of all ages limit their time in the sun and avoid other sources of UV radiation. It is best to stay out of the midday sun (from mid-morning to late afternoon) whenever you can. You also should protect yourself from UV radiation reflected by sand, water, snow, and ice. UV radiation can go through light clothing, windshields, windows, and clouds. Wear long sleeves and long pants of tightly woven fabrics, a hat with a wide brim, and sunglasses that absorb UV. Use sunscreen lotions. Sunscreen may help prevent skin cancer, especially broad-spectrum sunscreen (to filter UVB and UVA rays) with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. But you still need to avoid the sun and wear clothing to protect your skin. Stay away from sunlamps and tanning booths.\nThe best time to do this exam is after a shower or bath. You should check your skin in a room with plenty of light. You should use a full-length mirror and a hand-held mirror. It's best to begin by learning where your birthmarks, moles, and other marks are and their usual look and feel.\nCheck for anything new.\nNew mole (that looks different from your other moles) New red or darker color flaky patch that may be a little raised New flesh-colored firm bump Change in the size, shape, color, or feel of a mole Sore that does not heal\nCheck yourself from head to toe. Don't forget to check your back, scalp, genital area, and between your buttocks.\nLook at your face, neck, ears, and scalp. You may want to use a comb or a blow dryer to move your hair so that you can see better. You also may want to have a relative or friend check through your hair. It may be hard to check your scalp by yourself. Look at the front and back of your body in the mirror. Then, raise your arms and look at your left and right sides. Bend your elbows. Look carefully at your fingernails, palms, forearms (including the undersides), and upper arms. Examine the back, front, and sides of your legs. Also look around your genital area and between your buttocks. Sit and closely examine your feet, including your toenails, your soles, and the spaces between your toes.\nBy checking your skin regularly, you will learn what is normal for you. It may be helpful to record the dates of your skin exams and to write notes about the way your skin looks. If your doctor has taken photos of your skin, you can compare your skin to the photos to help check for changes. If you find anything unusual, see your doctor."}

Thanks for your answer.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. Low energy can be a symptom of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia can be a side effect of Humalog or Bantus. At the other side unusual tiredness, or weakness can be a symptom of lactic acidosis, a side effect of metformin. Other symptoms of lactic acidosis include abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite; diarrhea; fast or shallow breathing; a general feeling of discomfort; severe muscle pain or cramping. If you do not have any of these symptoms (apart low energy), Lactic acidosis can be excluded. I suggest checking your blood glucose several times every day(for some days)fasting, 2\u00a0hours after meals or random to see of you have hypoglycemia. In this case your insulines and your diabetes is the culprit of your low energy. If you do not have hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis, i suggest consulting your doctor for further investigations.(If the weakness persist)Hope I have answered to your questions.

Heavy sedation itself can cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, large stroke develops brain swelling in 48-72 hours and the rise in pressure due to this swelling can cause unresponsiveness. Since you said it was a massive stroke so keep fingers crossed and hope for the best. Good luck."}

Backstory: my dad died 2/2/17 (just a few weeks ago) from complications from amneodorane induced cirrhosis. He was dx with end strange liver disease in December and on 2/1/17 began vomiting blood, and well...they tried an edoscopy to band the bleed (he was put on a vent for this) that didn t work so he was brought down to have a TIPS procedure which lasted 6 hrs, maybe longer- once back in icu he was hypotensive and eventually bled out- 10 professionals worked on him. It was the most horrific sight, an hour and a half earlier he looked like my dad and after he died there was so much blood, he was so swollen and further bruised from the doctors valiant efforts to save him but is a sight I will never forget. I m writing you because I m scared about my own well being. I was anorexic/ eating disorder not specified/ anorexic with purging (self induced, lax, diuretic - all of it) for almost 20 year. The only negative physical ramification was a slightly elevated ast when on certain meds. I have stopped almost all medication and maintain a weight of 117 at 5 5 (take adderall 10 Mg 2-3x day, clonipan mg 1-2 time a day and occasionally 10 mg hydroxozine to sleep). On Jan 27 had my physical which I had put off and my ast was 225, alt 110, ferritin over 400 but everything else normal and no physical findings. I will drink a few glasses of wine a week, sometimes more sometimes less, and before those test had my period and took 4 Advil 4 times over two days. A week later (no alcohol, no otc) ast was to 70, alt 60....four weeks later my doctor retested again (I had wine during those four weeks, basically so many events for my dad s memory I wasn t paying attention to my own health) and on 2/16 ast was up to 125, alt stayed the same. Told my doctor about alcohol and cold medicine taken in the weeks leading up to the test. Neg for all hepatitis, hemochromatosis, all other blood levels still normal. She ran a ggt and it was 225! I was terrified- and I think she thinks I m lying bout alcohol intake. Nutrition hasn t been great but trying. I m getting an ultra sound Wednesday and see her again march 17 to retest all levels. Am I going to die like my dad? I m only 43. I am not an alcoholic but did enjoy wine, I am trying to eat better and drinking lots of warm water and lemon. I know you can t tell me for sure but I needed to reach out given the entire story.

The biomechanics of the muscle is quite different to balance the weight of the body and transform to a different axis. Getting a kinematic assessment by a sports physical therapist in a kinematic lab can help understand the muscle biomechanics. Since there is no pain, usual general doctors may not be able to understand the biomechanics of the muscle and the mechanism involved for this depression. When there is no pain there is nothing needed to worry as such. I have been seeing military candidates, and they have certain difference muscle biomechanics and by no chance they lead to any symptoms.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat does the term \"pulsus paradoxus\" mean?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "During inspiration, systolic blood pressure decreases, and pulse rate goes up. This is because the intrathoracic pressure becomes more negative relative to atmospheric pressure. This increases systemic venous return, so more blood flows into the right side of the heart. However, the decrease in intrathoracic pressure also expands the compliant pulmonary vasculature. This increase in pulmonary capacitance pools the blood in the lungs, and decreases pulmonary venous return, so flow is reduced to the left side of the heart. Reduced left-heart filling leads to a reduced stroke volume which manifests as a decrease in systolic blood pressure. The decrease in systolic blood pressure leads to a faster heart rate due to the baroreceptor reflex, which stimulates sympathetic outflow to the heart."}

My doctor told me that i have to undergo surgery. Is there any other option other than surgery? Is there any other treatment,is herbal cleansing effective? Also,what is the worst thing that could happen to me if i dont undergo surgery?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi.thank you for posting query at Chat Doctor.I thoroughly read your query and understood your concerns. Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder. Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides.1. Biliary colic -\"The pain without cholecystitis- gallbladder infection/inflammation\" - usually subsides within few hours to a day. Acute cholecystitis secondary to gallstones may be continuous and accompanied by fever.2. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones, though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder-surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid (UCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller (weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.3. Surgery lasts for less than one hour (usually half an hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time. I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion. You maybe asked to cut fat completely from your diet (or keep to minimum) after gall bladder surgery. Hope to answer your concern. Wish you good and sound health. Regards Chat Doctor. "}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat does the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve represent?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Methemoglobinemia is a blood disorder in which, due to increased production (congenital or acquired reasons), the red blood cells (RBCs) contain higher than normal levels of methemoglobin (MetHb) (>1%). Methemoglobin forms from the substitution of iron (Fe) in ferric/reduced (Fe 2+) form, as found in normal hemoglobin, with iron in oxidized (Fe 3+) form. The oxidation of Hb to MetHb (Fe 2+ to Fe 3+) occurs naturally in healthy people, as a result of the interaction of Hb with oxygen free radicals, which are produced during normal cell metabolism. The levels of MetHb though, never exceed more than 1%, if the protective reduction enzyme systems in the RBCs are working properly. Hemoglobin is the polypeptide protein in the RBCs, consisting of 2 alfa and 2 beta chains connected to an iron atom in ferric form, responsible for binding, carrying and distributing oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. MetHb is unable to bind oxygen, and in case of methemoglobinemia, the affinity of the remaining normal Hb (that has not been yet oxidized to MetHb) to oxygen is very high. This leads to leftward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, resulting in hypoxia and dyspnea, because no oxygen gets released to the tissues.\nMethemoglobinemia causes a leftward shift in the curve."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCan you provide a summary of second-degree AV block?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Electrocardiography (ECG) is employed to determine the type of second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block present. Follow-up ECGs and cardiac monitoring are appropriate.\nCommon symptoms in patients with second degree atrioventricular block include light-headedness, dizziness, fainting, fatigue, heart failure symptoms, pre-syncope, and syncope. Mobitz type 1 second degree AV block (Wenckebach) is often asymptomatic and can be seen in active, healthy patients without known heart disease. It may occur during exercise causing exertional intolerance or dizziness, or syncope. In patients with intermittent atrioventricular block leading syncope, initial evaluation including resting ECG, physical exam, echocardiography may be normal and intermittent episodes of the atrioventricular block can be found with long-term monitoring. Symptoms in patients with an atrioventricular block that conducts in a 2:1 pattern include fatigue and dizziness particularly if it persists during exertion.\nPatients with second degree AV block are usually asymptomatic. However, patients with previous chronic cardiac condition may appear in a distress. In symptomatic patients, common physical examination findings include bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Physical examination in patients with heart failure may include lung crackles, jugular venous distension, and peripheral edema.\nLaboratory tests in patients with second degree AV block include checking the levels of serum electrolytes as calcium, magnesium and potassium. Myocarditis related lab tests as lyme titres, HIV tests, PCR for enteroviruses, and Chagas titres should be done also.\nOn ECG, Type I Second degree AV block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval and progressive shortening of RR interval until a P wave is blocked. The RR interval containing the blocked P wave is shorter than the sum of 2 PP intervals. The increase in the PR interval is longest in the second conducted beat after the pause. Type II second-degree AV block is characterized by a constant PR interval. Most patients with type II second-degree AV block have associated bundle branch block.\nThere are no x-ray findings associated with second degree AV block.\nEchocardiography is useful for finding the underlying structural heart disease including left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with atrioventricular block, especially in the presence of LBBB pattern on resting ECG.\nTransesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or nuclear imaging are other advanced imagings that can be used in suspicion of structural heart disease in patients presented with bradycardia or bundle branch block.\nElectrocardiographic monitoring can be used to identify the changes in QRS morphology such as alternating bundle branch block in the presence of atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. Treadmill exercise stress testing may be diagnostic to differentiate that 2:1 atrioventricular block is Mobitz type I or II in some cases or identify the presence of infranodal disease. EPS may be helpful to determine the anatomic site of block in mobitz type 2 atrioventricular block including atrioventricular node, intra-His, or infra-His. Worsening atrioventricular block with isoproterenol and atropine may be suggestive of infranodal block. However, improvement of atrioventricular conduction with carotid sinus massage may be observed in patients with infranodal atrioventricular block."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nI could remember i had a sex with a lady i thought i trusted last year December 2011, By July 2012, i had this sudden pain that started on my palm and slight body itch which the doctor referred to as hive, i rushed to the hospital to check my sugar level the doctor told me it was okay and i was given a medicine for the hives . Same period, I started experiencing the pain like burning sensation on my feet and having a feeling like crawling sensation on my body. I became concern about this, moving from clinic to clinic then to a specialist hospital. I did a complete blood test which was very okay and complete blood count twice which were okay. Nothing was seen.. Later when my symptoms persist , i went to see my doctor again, he ordered to do Allergy test to check why i have hives which i did, i was only allergy to crabs (sea food) and mite, then i decided to take STDs test myself , which the result came out this way: VDML - nonreactive TPHA - Negative HIV 1 and 11 AB by Elisa - Non reactive Chlamydia IGG- 2.3 AB index. i still feel down sometimes feeling tiredness and burning sensation or tingling on the palm of my leg and hand.. Sometimes i feel crawling sensation on my face to my shoulder, Swollen Gland though already went down and i had sore throat like which was not painful whenever i swallow foods. I dont know know what is happening, I thought it could be HIV but the test says Negative.. James\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Dear James, I am sure you are worried sick about this but hope you have visited an Infectious Disease or GUM specialist to get the whole range of STDs checked out. Of course, the HIV 1 and 2 ab test is the right test given the time frame (when antibodies to the virus would have formed IF you have the reaction, but clearly not so) but the most sensitive test remains HIV PCR or Viral load if you had more encounters since. The feeling that you describe can be scabies but would be evident on clinical examination, although a rash would mean this is urticaria. House dust mite and seafood allergy occasionally come up positive on blood tests, so if you really have reactions (allergic) when you have seafood the result is correct. You need a throat swab, HIV PCR/VS and get seen by a specialist to lower the apprehension and hope things turn out well. As per the urticaria, long acting non sedating antihistamines for 3 months is the treatment. Thanks."}

Recommendations to offer appropriate protection for healthcare personnel performing laboratory testing on specimens from patients with suspected infection with Ebola virus are:\nRecommendations for risk assessment to staff: Risk assessments should be conducted by each laboratory director, biosafety officer, or other responsible personnel to determine the potential for sprays, splashes, or aerosols generated from laboratory procedures. They should adjust, as needed, PPE requirements, practices, and safety equipment controls to protect the laboratorian\u2019s skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.\nRecommendations for specimen collection by staff: Any person collecting specimens from a patient with a case of suspected Ebola virus disease should wear gloves, water-resistant gowns, full face shield or goggles, and masks to cover all of nose and mouth Additional PPE may be required in certain situations.\nRecommendations for laboratory testing by staff: Any person testing specimens from a patient with a suspected case of Ebola virus disease should wear gloves, water-resistant gowns, full face shield or goggles, and masks to cover all of nose and mouth, and as an added precaution use a certified class II Biosafety cabinet or Plexiglass splash guard with PPE to protect skin and mucous membranes. All manufacturer-installed safety features for laboratory instruments should be used.\nWaste generated during laboratory testing should be placed in leak-proof containment and discarded as regulated medical waste. To minimize contamination of the exterior of the waste bag, place this bag in a rigid waste container designed for this use. If available, steam sterilization (autoclave) or incineration as a waste treatment process can inactivate the virus and reduces waste volume. For equipment that drains directly into the sewer system, the United States sanitary sewer system handling processes (e.g., anaerobic digestion, composting, disinfection) are designed to safely inactivate infectious agents. However, check with your state's regulated medical waste program for more guidance and coordinate your waste management activities for the laboratory area with your medical waste contractor.\nSpecimens should be placed in a durable, leak-proof secondary container for transport within a facility. To reduce the risk of breakage or leaks, do not use any pneumatic tube system for transporting suspected EVD specimens.\nEbola virus is detected in blood only after the onset of symptoms, usually fever. It may take up to 3 days after symptoms appear for the virus to reach detectable levels. Virus is generally detectable by real-time RT-PCR from 3-10 days after symptoms appear.\nSpecimens ideally should be taken when a symptomatic patient reports to a healthcare facility and is suspected of having an Ebola exposure. However, if the onset of symptoms is <3 days, a later specimen may be needed to completely rule-out Ebola virus, if the first specimen tests negative.\nA minimum volume of 4mL whole blood in plastic collection tubes can be used to submit specimens for testing for Ebola virus. Do not submit specimens to CDC in glass containers or in heparinized tubes. Whole blood preserved with EDTA is preferred but whole blood preserved with; sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS), citrate, or with clot activator is acceptable. It is not necessary to separate and remove serum or plasma from the primary collection container. Specimens should be immediately stored or transported at 2-8\u00b0C or frozen on cold-packs to the CDC. Specimens other than blood may be submitted upon consult with the CDC by calling the Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100.\nStandard labeling should be applied for each specimen. The requested test only needs to be identified on the requisition and CDC specimen submission forms.\nShort-term storage of specimens prior to shipping to CDC should be at 4\u00b0C or frozen.\nSeveral diagnostic tests are available for detection of EVD. Acute infections will be confirmed using a real-time RT- PCR assay (CDC test directory code CDC -10309 Ebola Identification) in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Virus isolation may also be attempted. Serologic testing for IgM and IgG antibodies will be completed for certain specimens and to monitor the immune response in confirmed EVD patients.\nLassa fever is also endemic in certain areas of West Africa and may show symptoms similar to early EVD. Diagnostic tests available at CDC include but are not limited to RT-PCR, antigen detection, and IgM serology all of which may be utilized to rule out Lassa fever in EVD-negative patients.\nSpecimens collected for EVD testing should be packaged and shipped without attempting to open collection tubes or aliquot specimens.\nShown below is an image depicting a diagram on packaging and shipping clinical specimens of patients suspected to have EVD."}

New NOTES procedures should be experimental at the beginning, and they should be performed only in research labs in advanced institutions before being applied clinically.\nWe are on the way to apply many NOTES procedures clinically by the steady progression in the field. Patient safety and research trials that ensure this safety are paramount. Innovative instruments are needed by the surgeons and gastroenterologists to perform safe NOTES procedures. The development of such therapeutic techniques and advanced endoscopic devices will allow the endoscopists to perform various procedures more easily, such as resection of large and deep mucosal lesions and taking full thickness biopsies .\nInternational NOTES research groups, such as NOSCAR, EURO-NOTES, ASIA-NOTES, NOSLA (Natural Orifice Surgery Latin America), EATS (European Association of Translumenal Surgery) and others are currently working to improve the NOTES field and aim to provide worldwide registries for NOTES procedures.\nFinally, enthusiasm and conducting laboratory studies and clinical trials are required for further improvements in the field in order to provide the best possible patient care."}

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology. I suppose in your case we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life longs you are diabetic, and you have cholesterol problems under treatment we have blood pressure target for you bellow 120/80 mmHg. Diabetes and lipid disorders are cardiovascular risk factors, so we have to be much aggressive with our mean blood pressure values. It is normal to have blood pressure values above 140/80 mmHg soon after walking and fast heart beats. It is mandatory to have lower mean values during the day. Physical activity, losing weight and diet will help you to better control high pressure, diabetes and lipid disorder but this doesn't mean that you will stop your medications. Hypertension and diabetes will be treated medically livelong. Keeping on with your diet will help you to stay on lower dosage of medication as long as possible, but you should never stop your blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes medicine. Stopping them will rise all your values again because these are chronic disease. So, my opinion is to keep on with your physical activity and diet, continue your medicine and after two months discus with your doctors for your medicine dosage after measuring once a wile your blood pressure and your diabetes. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards."}

Unfortunately, Depo-Provera is a very long-lasting contraceptive. For convenience\u2019s sake, having to only worry about birth control every three months is extremely helpful. However, in some women, normal ovulation can take many months to come back some even up to one year. The reason for that is that the hormone that is in Depo-Provera is designed to be long-lasting and different people metabolize the Chat Doctor.  Also, the fact that you had been on Demo for four years, and likely you did not get your period during that time is a sign that your estrogen levels also had been suppressed by the medication. If at one year since stopping the Depo-Provera you do not have any sign of real menstruation, I would recommend that you and your partner see a gynecologist for evaluation. They could do an analysis of your hormones, and medication to help stimulate you to ovulate again may be a possibility. So I know it is difficult, please try to be patient if at the end of three months you still have not resumed normal menstrual cycle, I would recommend evaluation by a gynecologist or endocrinologist to evaluate why you are not menstruating. It may be recommended also for your partner to do a semen analysis, as most doctors want to know that there is no male factor involved in your fertility issues.

During peacetime, they provide the majority of anesthesia services for retired service members, active duty military, and their dependents. CRNAs function as the only licensed independent anesthesia practitioners at many military treatment facilities, including Navy ships at sea. They are also the leading provider of anesthesia for the Veterans Administration and Public Health medical facilities.\nCRNAs have made a significant contribution in the provision of anesthesia services in every U.S. war during the 20th century. During World War I, America's nurse anesthetists played a vital role in the care of combat troops in France. From 1914 to 1915, two years prior to America entering the war, Dr. George Crile and nurse anesthetists Agatha Hodgins and Mabel Littleton served in the Lakeside Unit at the American Ambulance at Neuilly, France.  They even helped train the French and British nurses and physicians in anesthesia care. After the war, France continued to use nurse anesthetists, however, Britain adopted a physician only policy that continues today. In 1917, with American participation in the war, for the first time the U.S. Military started training nurse anesthetists for service. The Army and Navy sent nurses to various hospitals (e.g. Mayo clinic in Rochester, Lakeside hospital in Cleveland) for anesthesia training and then overseas service.   Nurse anesthetist Sophie Gran Winton served at an army hospital in Chateau-Thierry, France, and earned the French Croix de Guerre medal, along with other awards, for her anesthesia service.  Anne Penland was the first nurse anesthetist on the British Front, and was blinded in one eye from a shrapnel wound.   American nurse anesthetists also served in World War II and Korea, receiving numerous citations and awards.  They are represented by such heroes Second Lieutenant Mildred Irene Clark, who provided anesthesia in the heat of battle for casualties from the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.  During the Vietnam war, nurse anesthetists served as both CRNAs and flight nurses, and outnumbered physician anesthesiologist by 3:1.  CRNAs have been casualties of war. Lieutenants Kenneth R. Shoemaker, Jr. and Jerome E. Olmsted, where killed in an air evac mission in route to Qui Nhon, Vietnam. A CRNA was also a prisoner of war. Army nurse anesthetist Annie Mealer endured a three year imprisonment by the Japanese in the Philippines, and was released in 1945.  For Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, CRNAs comprise the largest group of anesthesia providers at forward positioned medical treatment facilities.  In addition, they play a key role in the continuing education and training of Department of Defense nurses and technicians in the care of wartime trauma patients."}

Actually amitriptyline HCl is a type of antidepressant used for balancing chemicals in your brain. Sometimes used as a painkiller or a sedating agent to help you sleep with patients having severe chronic pain.  You could not use it without your doctor prescription especially with Prozac as both antidepressants may cause severe side effects sometimes very dangerous or even fatal with increased doses.  In my opinion if you have a kind of neuropathic pain pregabalin or gabapentin will be more reliable but you have to ask your trading doctor for best dosing if you are using any other medications for other health issues.  You may avoid heavy lifting, over weighing, vigorous movements, bad sleeping or sitting postures and high cholesterol or high protein and salty components, and you will feel better soon.  For my patients I recommend painkillers like Advil tab when needed, hot gentle massaging with topical gels of anti-inflammatory, B12 vitamin supplements, muscle relaxants will be effective for most of the cases. Steroid tabs or injection may be needed in more sever cases.  B12 supplements and pregabalin have best results with nerve pains, if pain persist I recommend some lab investigations like urinalysis, ASCOT, Rheumatoid factor and X-rays, MRI and follow them up with your physician for proper evaluation and management of the underlying causes of such nerve pain.

NF1 is due to mutations in the NF1 gene, located at chromosome 17q11.2.   Lisch nodules are generally not present in central NF(neurofibromatosis)/NF(neurofibromatosis)-2. Neurofibromin, the protein product encoded by the gene, is expressed in many tissues, including brain, kidney, spleen, and thymus. Mutations in the NF1 gene result in loss of production or reduced function of protein; this causes a wide spectrum of clinical findings, including NF1 -associated tumors.   Histopathologically, Lisch nodules are composed of melanocytes and spindle cells, usually concentrated on the superficial layers of the iris stroma.    The spindle cells are larger than the normal iris melanocytes. Immunohistochemical studies show positive reaction against the following Vimentin Smooth muscle actin Neuron specific enolase."}

More often, they increase in discomfort as pus collects.\nBoils usually must open and drain before they will heal. This usually occurs in less than 2 weeks.\nWarm, moist compresses help boils drain, which speeds healing. Gently soak the area with a warm, moist cloth several times each day. Never squeeze a boil or try to cut it open at home. This can spread the infection and make it worse. When the boil finally does burst and drain, continue to put warm, wet compresses on the area.\nDeep or large boils may need to be drained with surgery by a health care provider. Treatment by a health care provider is needed if:\nA boil lasts longer than 2 weeks A boil comes back The boil is on the spine or the middle of the face The boil occurs with a fever or other symptoms, because the infection may spread and cause complications\nCareful hygiene is important:\nClean draining boils often. Wash your hands very well after touching a boil. Do not re-use or share washcloths or towels. Wash clothing, washcloths, towels, and sheets or other items that contact infected areas in very hot (preferably boiling) water. Change dressings often and throw them out with the drainage, such as by placing them in a bag that can be closed tightly before throwing it out.\nAntibacterial soaps and antibiotics placed on the skin are of little help once a boil has formed. Antibiotics taken by mouth or given as a shot may help a more severe infection or if the boil returns."}

About a week ago after having sex with my wife, I noticed a rash starting on my inner upper thigh.

It wasnt too bad mainly bedtime where I couldnt get comfortable was where I noticed it the most. Next the tip of penis started hurting like a slight burning bit it was more so my actual urinary tract. Finally I went to emerg at like 2 am because I had just had enough. Showed him the rash which by then was almost gone. He said the rash was nothing at all. No discharge from penis so he ruled out STD which I was worried about because I read they can at times lay dormant for years and Ive been faithfully married for 3. Anyways he poked around my testicles and had me cough and I said it wasnt feeling any more or less pain it was just a constant painful sensation. So he said it was some kind of infection and put me on antibiotics for 2 weeks. This is only my second day on them but nothing has changed the pain and tingling just seems to be moving. From both testicles to mainly my left testicle and left thigh now have the same feeling. I find it all to be extremely odd and troubling. Any input would be great!\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello, Rash on the thigh after sex is commonly due to Jock Itch(Tina courts).

It sounds like hiatus hernia. All this is caused by high acid and legal nerve irritation.  This disorder can cause such difficulties, and you should do gastrostomy to evaluate this. Symptoms that are experienced in such conditions are pain and tightness in upper stomach, bloating, breathing difficulties, heartburn, feeling of lump and sore in throat, gurgling sound in throat, fatigue and loss of appetite. Symptoms are aggravated after meal, long sitting, leaning forward, stress and anxiety. In the beginning this is treated by changing dietary habits. You should avoid alcohol, coffee,smoking, fats and fast food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body.

Does this effects sexual Life as I m getting married ?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Bronchitis is inflammation of airways. And best treatment for this is inhaled treatment. Inhaled treatment reaches lungs directly, so onset of action is fast. It acts on lungs only, so systemic side effects are minimal. Hence, it is better to take inhaled treatment as compare to oral treatment for bronchitis. And if untreated, this bronchitis can gradually worsen over period of time. It can cause coughing, expectoration, breathlessness on exertion, weakness etc. Sexual activity is considered as heavy exertion. So untreated bronchitis can also interfere with your sexual activity. So better to treat bronchitis by inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Do you think you can help me identify what is going on and how I can finally get rid of it.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Your symptoms of abdominal pain and straining for passing stool points to a chronic inflammation/infection of your intestines. Most of the intestinal infections do come from food eaten from outside under unhygienic conditions. Therefore, you have to avoid taking food from outside if you do. Also avoid spicy, oily food, and include enough roughage and liquids in your diet. I would rather go for a stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive. The extra skin what you have felt could be an external skin tag, which occurs if anytime you had fissure in ANO due to chronic constipation and straining. This could be known only by a physical examination, and so I would advise you to take appointment with a general surgeon who could do that to diagnose the condition and then manage it appropriately. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."}

Answer: Genital herpes is usually treated with antiviral tablets, such as acyclovir. You will need to take a course of acyclovir for at least five days, or longer if you still have new blisters and open sores forming on your genital area. In a primary infection, mild local antiseptics such as potassium permanganate (KMnO4 lotion) diluted to 1/10 000 (pale pink), only a small amount applied twice a day for 10 minutes, may help to avoid super infection of the lesions. For the pain paracetamol or ibuprofen tablets are typically recommended.  Make sure to pat the skin Chat Doctor. Avoid stress, fatigue, and any irritation to the genital area.

I would suggest you to avoid wearing the earrings for a few days and clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply an antibiotic ointment over it. Cool compresses can also be relieving.

Ankle swelling is a sign of heart failure in patients of aortic stenosis and I cannot stress enough the need for him to go the hospital immediately. On top of that tightness in the chest is a classical angina pain which means the heart is overworked.The ankle is swollen because the heart is not able to pump the blood as it is in failure and so the blood accumulates in the extremities due to gravity. This leads to an increase in interstitial fluid and causes ankle swelling or edema in the medical term. I hope your father feels better"}

Non-infectious causes include cancers, systemic lupus erythematosus and certain drugs. The most common cause of meningitis is viral, and often runs its course within a few days. Bacterial meningitis is the second most frequent type and can be serious and life-threatening. Numerous microorganisms may cause bacterial meningitis, but Neisseria meningitidis (\"meningococcus\") and Streptococcus pneumoniae (\"pneumococcus\") are the most common pathogens in patients without immune deficiency, with meningococcal disease being more common in children. Staphylococcus aureus may complicate neurosurgical operations, and Listeria monocytogenes is associated with poor nutritional state and alcoholicism. Haemophilus influenzae (type B) incidence has been much reduced by immunization in many countries. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the causative agent of tuberculosis) rarely causes meningitis in Western countries but is common and feared in countries where tuberculosis is endemic."}

Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor I will keep a possibility of Alopecia Area ta(AA) that is active or extending. Alopecia Area ta(AA) is an autoimmune condition. It usually presents as smooth bald patches of hair loss, most commonly over the scalp. The patches of Alopecia Area ta are smooth, and usually there is no evidence of inflammation like scaling or erythema or itching. When the disease is active, the patches may extend Or get bigger. However, AA is self limiting in most and ultimately new patches stop appearing and extending as disease activity gradually vanes away. Intra-lesional depot preparation of Triamcinolone acetone is the treatment of choice in adults. The injection seems to have worked in your case. However, new patches may form or existing patches may increase in size, just as the case in you. In most cases it is self limiting and new or extending patches also need to be injected in the same way. However, in some cases dermatologists may choose to start patients on Oral Minipulse (OMP) to arrest the progression of disease. You may discuss more about this with your treating doctor.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is asthma induced by exercise and how is it connected to it?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The major goal of therapy in exercise-induced asthma is to ensure exercise is not avoided.\nIn athletes who wish to continue their sport, and/or do so at times in adverse conditions, preventive measures, including altered training techniques and medications, can be taken.\nSome athletes take advantage of the refractory period by precipitating an attack by \"warming up\" and then timing their competition such that it occurs during the refractory period. Step-wise training works in a similar fashion. An athlete warms up in stages of increasing intensity, using the refractory period generated by each stage to get up to a full workload.\nTherapy should be routinely monitored with the assessment of peak expiratory flow rate performed before and after the exercise. Methacholine challenge test is another alternative to objectively assess response to therapy.  \nFish oil supplementation may represent a potentially beneficial non-pharmacologic intervention for patients with exercise-induced asthma. \nThe most common medication approach is to use a beta agonist about twenty minutes before exercise. \nEquipotent doses of the bronchodilators such as salmeterol, formoterol and terbutaline have shown to be effective with respect to their short-term protective potency against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. \nTachyphylaxis developed to the protective effect of long and short-acting beta-2 agonist and hence is less effective when used for exercise-induced asthma. However, it remains extremely effective in the prevention of bronchospasm when used immediately before exercise.     \nNedocromil and cromolyn administered by a pressurized aerosol has shown to provide equal protection against exercise-induced asthma in children.  A small randomized study, has shown the additive effects of combining cromolyn and beta-2 agonist and may be indicated in high-performance athletes.  Nedocromil sodium used before exercise has shown to reduce the severity and duration of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.  \nInhaled corticosteroids used for weeks and months before exercise significantly attenuated exercise-induced bronchoconstriction; however, it does not provide any short-term benefit.    \nMontelukast has shown to provide significant protection against exercise-induced asthma and further reduce the urinary excretion of leukotriene that is commonly observed after exercise.   However, leukotriene inhibitors are not effective in all patients with exercise induced asthma. \nOther pharmacological agents that have been hypothesized to provide therapeutic benefits in patients with exercise induced asthma include frusemide,  prostaglandin-E2,  indomethacin,  and heparin. \nAs evidenced by the many professional athletes who have overcome E.I.A. using some combination of the above treatments, the prognosis is usually very good. Olympic swimmers Tom Dolan, Amy Van Dyken, and Nancy Hogshead, baseball Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter, and American football player Jerome Bettis are among the many who have done so. At the same time, it should be noted that according to International Olympic Committee statistics, during most of Olympic Games in last 20 years from 1/3 to 2/3 of athletes claimed to have asthma. Some medical experts tie such inordinate rates of reported asthma with athletes' desire to use complex medication to help them achieve better results.\nA randomized crossover study compared oral montelukast with inhaled salmeterol, both given two hours before exercise. Both drugs had similar benefit but montelukast lasted 24 hours. \nIn a large randomized study in children, monotherapy with montelukast and combination therapy with montelukast and budesonide yielded higher beneficial results in comparison to budesonide monotherapy and combined therapy with budesonide and formoterol."}

I am 47 years old and have had issues my whole life with diarrhea or at least very loose stools nearly every day and have sufferred severe stomach cramps and pain. I also have had nausea more days in my life than I haven t. Over the years, I ve had every test you can imagine starting when I was 10 years old. Nothing has ever been found. In fact, my parents were told that I was creating my symptoms for attention since my only other sibling has cerebral palsy . I even had a specialist I was referred to for fatty liver disease tell my the pains in my stomach were psychosomatic. After 3-4 days of no gluten products, I began to feel better. No diarrhea, no nausea, very little stomach pains. Yesterday I ate several biscuits with no other gluten in the entire day. About an hour after I ate the biscuits, I began to feel a tightness at the base of my throat. I thought it was heartburn, but there was never any burning and antacids didn t help. It continued to get worse and I felt that I had to consciously take deep breaths to get enough air. If I sipped on ice cold water the symptoms would subside for a few minutes - maybe 3 minutes then immediately return. I became concerned this was an allergic reaction to the gluten. I have no other allergies other than seasonal and Sulfa medications. I took a 25 mg Benadryl which did nothing. Two hours later, I took some pseudofed, the only other allergy medication I had on hand. I seriously considered going to the ER but the symptoms reached a certain level and stopped progressing so I did not go. It was 6-7 hours before the symptoms finally went away. I have always eaten a lot of bread and flour so I find it hard to believe that these three biscuits could have caused these symptoms, but I didn t have anything else that I haven t ever had before and this is the only thing I have eaten in a week that had any gluten in that I m aware of.

I haven t done it anymore because I noticed that when I went to pee there was pink blood on my tissue . After I had orgasm from masturbating( I m not sexually active) I would go use the bathroom and wipe and there would be pink blood on my tissue. I thought is was spotting. But, at the same time my stomach would hurt but not where it hurts when I m on my period. It hurts and is very uncomfortable up where my breasts are like I m having an ulcer. I m not sure what this is. I ve been looking up ulcers and bleeding ulcers and I m very scared if I have one. I don t know what I should do.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi, Nothing to worry. Please stop taking Aspirin as it doesn't help in Acute heart attack. You may get Stomach ulcers due to Aspirin. But, if there is bleeding from Ulcer in the stomach, it comes as black, tarry stools. Most common cause of pink blood on your tissue is due to trauma caused by Masturbation. If your stools are normal colored, then bleeding is excluded from the Stomach due to Aspirin. Just go for an Endoscopy test to exclude Ulcers/Bleeding ulcers. All the best."}

The material on the net shows only relief with inflammatory conditions and some types of cancer. In your children case, neither of these situations apply. Rather, the symptoms of pain and insomnia are probably due to compression of nerve roots as they exit the brain.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should get done chest x-ray or CT thorax to detect tubercular infiltration. Your blood report like IGM for TB is positive but manitou test is negative. Your sputum for AFB is also negative. So we can not say it is 100% tuberculosis. You might be having tuberculosis as you are having cough with hemoptysis. So further evaluation with chest x-ray or CT thorax is needed. Because some radiological findings like upper lobe infiltration, cavitary lesion, tree in bud appearance etc. are characteristic of tuberculosis. So if any of these is present than you may need anti-tubercular Chat Doctor.  Bronchoscopy with BAD (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis is also more informative in diagnosis of tuberculosis. So better to get done these investigations first to rule out tuberculosis in your case. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

The best diagnosis is a high resolution ultrasonography. Some blood, urine and stool tests. A therapeutic trial with a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotics under the guidance of a pediatrician / Surgeon always helps to solve the problem and to get a diagnosis.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the medium used for growth?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths (liquid nutrient medium) or Lysogeny broth (LB medium). Liquid mediums are often mixed with agar and poured into petri dishes to solidify. These agar plates provide a solid medium on which microbes may be cultured. Bacteria grown in liquid cultures often form colloidal suspensions.\nThe differences between growth media used for cell culture and those used for microbiological culture are due to the fact that cells derived from whole organisms and grown in culture often cannot grow without the addition of, for instance, hormones or growth factors which usually occur in vivo.  In the case of animal cells, this difficulty is often addressed by the addition of blood serum to the medium. In the case of microorganisms, there are no such limitations, as they are often unicellular organisms. One other major difference is that animal cells in culture are often grown on a flat surface to which they attach, and the medium is provided in a liquid form, which covers the cells. In contrast, bacteria such as Escherichia coli may be grown on solid media or in liquid media.\nAn important distinction between growth media types is that of defined versus undefined media.  A defined medium will have known quantities of all ingredients. For microorganisms, they consist of providing trace elements and vitamins required by the microbe and especially a defined carbon source and nitrogen source. Glucose or glycerol are often used as carbon sources, and ammonium salts or nitrates as inorganic nitrogen sources). An undefined medium has some complex ingredients, such as yeast extract or casein hydrolysate, which consist of a mixture of many, many chemical species in unknown proportions. Undefined media are sometimes chosen based on price and sometimes by necessity - some microorganisms have never been cultured on defined media.\nA good example of a growth medium is the wort used to make beer. The wort contains all the nutrients required for yeast growth, and under anaerobic conditions, alcohol is produced. When the fermentation process is complete, the combination of medium and dormant microbes, now beer, is ready for consumption.\nUndefined media (also known as basal or complex media) is an undefined media that contains:\na carbon source such as glucose for bacterial growth water various salts need for bacterial growth a source of amino acids and nitrogen (e.g., beef, yeast extract)\nThis is an undefined medium because the amino acid source contains a variety of compounds with the exact composition unknown. Nutrient media contain all the elements that most bacteria need for growth and are non-selective, so they are used for the general cultivation and maintenance of bacteria kept in laboratory culture collections.\nDefined media (also known as chemical defined media)\nall the chemicals used are known and does not contain any animal, yeast, plant tissue.\nDifferential medium\nsome sort of indicator, typically a dye, is added, that allows for the differentiation of particular chemical reactions occurring during growth.\nMinimal media are those that contain the minimum nutrients possible for colony growth, generally without the presence of amino acids, and are often used by microbiologists and geneticists to grow \"wild type\" microorganisms. Minimal media can also be used to select for or against recombinants or exconjugants.\nMinimal medium typically contains:\na carbon source for bacterial growth, which may be a sugar such as glucose, or a less energy-rich source like succinate various salts, which may vary among bacteria species and growing conditions; these generally provide essential elements such as magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur to allow the bacteria to synthesize protein and nucleic acid water\nSupplementary minimal media are a type of minimal media that also contains a single selected agent, usually an amino acid or a sugar. This supplementation allows for the culturing of specific lines of auxotrophic recombinants.\n\nSelective media are used for the growth of only select microorganisms. For example, if a microorganism is resistant to a certain antibiotic, such as ampicillin or tetracycline, then that antibiotic can be added to the medium in order to prevent other cells, which do not possess the resistance, from growing. Media lacking an amino acid such as proline in conjunction with E. coli unable to synthesize it were commonly used by geneticists before the emergence of genomics to map bacterial chromosomes.\nSelective growth media are also used in cell culture to ensure the survival or proliferation of cells with certain properties, such as antibiotic resistance or the ability to synthesize a certain metabolite. Normally, the presence of a specific gene or an allele of a gene confers upon the cell the ability to grow in the selective medium. In such cases, the gene is termed a marker.\nSelective growth media for eukaryotic cells commonly contain neomycin to select cells that have been successfully transfected with a plasmid carrying the neomycin resistance gene as a marker. Gancyclovir is an exception to the rule as it is used to specifically kill cells that carry its respective marker, the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK).\nSome examples of selective media include:\neosin-methylen blue agar (EMB) that contains methylene blue \u2013 toxic to Gram-positive bacteria, allowing only the growth of Gram negative bacteria YM (yeast and mold) which has a low pH, deterring bacterial growth blood agar (used in strep tests), which contains beef heart blood that becomes transparent in the presence of hemolytic Streptococcus MacConkey agar for Gram-negative bacteria Hektoen Enteric (HE) which is selective for Gram-negative bacteria Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) which is selective for Gram-positive bacteria and differential for mannitol xylose lysine desoxyscholate (XLD), which is selective for Gram-negative bacteria Buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, which is selective for certain gram-negative bacteria, especially Legionella pneumophila\nDifferential media or indicator media distinguish one microorganism type from another growing on the same media.  This type of media uses the biochemical characteristics of a microorganism growing in the presence of specific nutrients or indicators (such as neutral red, phenol red, eosin y, or methylene blue) added to the medium to visibly indicate the defining characteristics of a microorganism. This type of media is used for the detection of microorganisms and by molecular biologists to detect recombinant strains of bacteria.\nExamples of differential media include:\nEosin methylene blue (EMB), which is differential for lactose and sucrose fermentation MacConkey (MCK), which is differential for lactose fermentation Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA), which is differential for mannitol fermentation X-gal plates, which are differential for lac operon mutants"}

This normal action becomes a snapping hip syndrome when one of these connective tissue bands thickens and catches with motion. The underlying bursa may also become inflamed, causing a painful external snapping hip syndrome.\nMedial extra-articular\nIn this case the iliopsoas tendon catches on the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS), the lesser trochanter, or the iliopectineal ridge during hip extension, as the tendon moves from an anterior lateral to a posterior medial position. With overuse, the resultant friction may eventually cause painful symptoms, resulting in muscle trauma, bursitis, or inflammation in the area."}

In Sept. 11, I had an abdominal hernia repaired. Prior to the surgery, and for more than 1 year, I suffered constant fatigue , general nausea, vomiting, bouts of constipation / diarrhea . I saw both my GP and OBGYN , but neither found a cause / solution. The quality of my daily life was in the toilet (pardon the pun). One day, I pushed my chair back from the table, stood up, and a peach sized globe popped out of my navel. I pushed it back in, went to a different GP (in the same office as my original one), and he confirmed the abdominal hernia. I had surgery 2 days later. My symptoms improved, but have never disappeared. Ever since surgery, the scar has been some combination of red, inflamed, irritated, itchy, and doesn t seem to want to heal. Sometimes part of it splits open, scabs over, but always stays red. I went back to the office for post-op visits & expressed some concerns; something just didn t seem right. A nurse told me I was over-reacting and just need to relax about it. Needless to say, I haven t been back to that office for any further follow-ups. In Dec 11 I saw my dermatologist (for dyshidrotic eczema ) and, on a whim, asked about the scar. She was very concerned, mentioned keloid tissue, the need to manage the formation, care for surrounding tissue / organs, etc., and she injected quite a bit of hyaluronic acid into the scar, in different parts of my navel, & into the skin surrounding the scar (the scar is just over 1 long, just below my navel). It didn t take long to notice the hard tissue under my skin disappearing. Now, the hard tissue is back, the scar is red and itchy, and I m suffering bouts of fatigue and diarrhea. Are these occurrences related to the mesh? What should be my next step? Visit my Dr. (that confirmed the hernia) and ask for a CT or MRI? How are culprits to abdominal distress discovered and treated? Thanks in advance for your insight and advice.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi. As per your question, any injury/incision over your body leads to keloid formation. It can't be prevented. It should be managed only with Intro keloid injections. Regarding red scar, it may be due to underlying mesh. But diarrhea may not be due to mesh, as the mesh will be fixed to surrounding structures with Non-absorbable sutures. As mesh is a foreign body, it may lead to infection. So, Clinical examination should be done first.CT/MRI are not needed now."}

Viz: nausea / vomiting/ abdominal distention / constipation or loose motions/ fever/ fainting or collapsing / sweating/ and so on. If these symptoms are not there, it is less probably due to pancreatitis. Large stomach hernia can cause this type of pain if the opening (neck) is small and there is entrapment of intestines. If one goes for an X-ray in standing lateral position, one can see intestine being trapped. Such a simple test. Ultrasonography and serum lipase and amylase enzymes increase in pancreatitis. Well there still can be another reasons, which can be diagnosed on a good clinical examination and your proper history. Let me know more."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the physiological mechanism behind Necrotizing Fasciitis?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The pathophysiology of necrotizing fasciitis is common to all types of necrotizing fasciitis, but the speed of development and associated clinical features differs depending on the causative organisms. \nThe transmission of pathogens occurs through the following routes:  \nExternal trauma (e.g., laceration, abrasion, burn, insect bite) Direct spread from a perforated viscus (particularly colon, rectum, or anus) or another surgical procedure (e.g., vasectomy, hemorrhoidectomy) Urogenital organ Perirectal abscess Decubitus ulcer\nFollowing transmission, the bacteria uses the entry site to invade the fascial planes which causes the wide spread necrosis of superficial fascia, deep fascia, subcutaneous fat, nerves, arteries, and veins. Superficial skin and deeper muscles are typically spared. In late stages, lesions develop liquefactive necrosis at all tissue levels.\nNecrotizing fasciitis in neonate\nNecrotizing fasciitis can be a serious complication of omphalitis in the neonate. The omphalitis may progress resulting in purplish discoloration and periumbilical necrosis. The necrosis may extend to the flanks and even onto the chest wall.\nThe pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis is the result of bacterial and host factors.  \nType 1 NF\nThe exact pathogenesis of type 1 necrotizing fasciitis is not fully understood. It is thought that type 1 NF is caused by polymicrobial species that work synergistically to enhance the spread of infection. Synergistic NF is comparatively slow process evolving over days. It usually develops in the area where gut flora breaches the mucosa, entering the tissue planes.\nType 2 NF\nGroup A streptococcus is the most common causative agent of type 2 NF.   Type 2 NF is initially insidious in onset but progress more rapidly.  The disease may appear spontaneously with no obvious focus. Hematogenous infection from many foci such as skin, throat, ascending vaginitis, primary peritonitis reaches the fascial layer or seeds vimentin exposed by muscle damage. Direct inoculation of GAS through wounds or associated surgery is less common. The pathogenesis of type 2 NF is the result of the following process:\nInhibition of phagocytosis of bacteria by hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein Adherence of bacteria to host cell through adherence factors such as M protein, protein F and lipoteichoic acid  Release of exotoxins (streptococcal pyogenic exotoxins and superantigen) into blood produce massive proliferation of T cells and cascading release of cytokines activating inflammatory process Activation of inflammatory process which begins to kill bacteria The streptococci release massive amounts of enzymes, hemolysins, DNAase, proteases and collagenases which destroy the normal skin and surrounding tissue with progressive coagulative necrosis The inflamed cells release more cytokines that stimulate more inflammatory cells The massive release of cytokines result in systemic inflammatory response syndrome resulting in shock, organ failure, depression of myocardial function and immune suppression Stimulation of T-cells by superantigen causes activation of complement pathway, the bradykinin - kallikrein system, and the coagulation cascade, worsening small vessel thrombosis and tissue ischemia. Tissue ischemia impedes oxidative destruction of bacteria by polymorphonuclear cells and prevents adequate delivery of antibiotics. The blood flow to local tissue is compromised due to thrombosis of large number of dermal capillaries by the local hypercoaguable state, platelet - neutrophil plugging of vessels and increased interstitial pressure\nNerves supplying the necrotizing areas of skin die, the central areas become anaesthetic and peripheral areas remain tender In later stages, infection from deeper layers ascends, producing edema of epidermal and dermal layers (peau d'orange) and a woody firmness of the tissues The fascial and nerve destruction results in sensory and motor deficits, which causes progression of hemorrhagic bulae to cutaneous gangrene\nRecurrent necrotizing fasciitis\nRecurrent NF is seen in following conditions: \nMethicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Complement C4 deficiency\nOn gross pathology the characteristic findings of necrotizing fasciitis include: \nSubcutaneous emphysema Edema Erythema Bulae Skin sloughing Dull grey discoloration\nBy Nephron - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=19107063\nOn microscopic histopathological analysis, the characteristic findings of necrotizing fasciitis are \nEarly stages\nObliterative vasculitis with microangiopathic thrombosis Acute inflammation of subcutaneous tissue Superficial hyaline necrosis along with edema and inflammation of the dermis and subcutaneous fat Dense neutrophil -predominant inflammatory infiltrate\nLate stages\nNoninflammatory intravascular coagulation and hemorrhage Myonecrosis\nBy Piotr Smuszkiewicz, Iwona Trojanowska and Hanna Tomczak - Late diagnosed necrotizing fasciitis as a cause of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome: A case report.

The procedure may be repeated standing to evaluate carotid sinus vasodepressor hypersensitivity.\nPatients may have either a heart rate fall, the cardioinhibitory response, or fall in blood pressure, the vasodepressor response. Weiss and Baker also reported that some patients suffered from syncope without any fall in heart rate or blood pressure, they called the primary cerebral type. \nThe test is not all-together sensitive or specific. If normal patients are tested, some will have a fall in blood pressure and heart rate despite no history of syncope. Other patients with history of syncope will have a fall in HR or BP but no reproducible symptoms at the time of the test.\nMany patients will give a history of syncope or near-syncope with movement of the neck, wearing of a tight collar, shaving, etc. This history is not necessary, however, to make the diagnosis. Patients are usually upright, often standing, and develop a sudden episode of syncope, often with an associated fall. Small convulsive movements often occur with the loss of consciousness. The loss of consciousness is usually <30 seconds, and patients awake quickly with no clouding of consciousness.\nThe syndrome has been described in patients in chronic Afib, in addition to patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).\nPressing on the eyes can elicit a vagal response, but this is not part of the syndrome.\nCaeful examination should be done to assess for carotid bruits and to assure that there is no obvious mass compressing the carotid (such as tumors or lymph nodes)."}

I can understand your concern. No need to worry about heart diseases as you are too young (22 years) and having normal ECG recently. In my opinion, you are mostly having stress and anxiety related HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) because you are having chest pain and burping immediately after eating.  HERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest pain, burping etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid junk food. 4. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. 5.

These symptoms very are often getting worse during bleeding time. Endometriosis can also cause adhesions in abdominal cavity what leads to bloats, constipation and many others symptoms of partial intestines' obstruction. Diagnostics of endometriosis is quite hard as ultrasound and CT scans can show nothing.

Compounds involved include glucose, amino acids, uric acid, phosphate, and bicarbonate.\nThe reduced reabsorption of bicarbonate results in type 2 or proximal renal tubular acidosis, which may in some cases exist on its own, or more usually in combination with the Fanconi syndrome.\nIn many cases, the disease is developed in the context of multi-system genetic diseases(e.g Cystinosis, Galactosemia). And in many others, high exposure to toxic substances(e.g heavy metals, drugs) is discovered as the main risk factor. The disease can also develop as a consequence of other acquired diseases(e.g multiple myeloma, PNH) .\nPatients mainly present with dehydration, growth failure, rickets (children) and osteomalacia (adults)  .\nIt is named after Guido Fanconi, a Swiss pediatrician; this may be a misnomer since Fanconi himself never identified it as a syndrome .\nIt should not be confused with Fanconi anemia, a separate disease ."}

The impulse now spreads leftward and inferiorly through the atria (at first only in the RA, then in both RA and LA and finally only in the LA). Small fascicles of tissue which resemble conduction tissue can be demonstrated in the atria, called intra-atrial pathways which connect both atria and help organize atrial depolarization. A reasonable concept is to consider the spread of electrical stimulation through the atria as ripples on a pond with the pebble falling into the pond at the SA node and then spreading throughout the atria. Atrial depolarization inscribes the P wave on the ECG."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat does the Electrophoretic mobility shift assay refer to?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "A mobility shift assay generally involves electrophoretic separation of a protein-DNA or protein-RNA mixture on a polyacrylamide or agarose gel for a short period (about 1.5-2 hr for a 15- to 20-cm gel).  The speed at which different molecules (and combinations thereof) move through the gel is determined by their size and charge, and to a lesser extent, their shape (see gel electrophoresis). The control lane (DNA probe without protein present) will contain a single band corresponding to the unbound DNA or RNA fragment. However, assuming that the protein is capable of binding to the fragment, the lane with protein present will contain another band that represents the larger, less mobile complex of nucleic acid probe bound to protein which is'shifted' up on the gel (since it has moved more slowly).\nUnder the correct experimental conditions, the interaction between the DNA and protein is stabilized and the ratio of bound to unbound nucleic acid on the gel reflects the fraction of free and bound probe molecules as the binding reaction enters the gel. This stability is in part due to the low ionic strength of the buffer, but also due to a \"caging effect\", in that the protein, surrounded by the gel matrix, is unable to diffuse away from the probe before they recombine. If the starting concentrations of protein and probe are known, the affinity of the protein for the nucleic acid sequence may be determined. If the protein concentration is not known, it can be determined by increasing the concentration of DNA probe until further increments do not increase the fraction of protein bound. By comparison with a set of standard dilutions of free probe run on the same gel, the number of moles of protein can be calculated. \nAn antibody that recognizes the protein can be added to this mixture to create an even larger complex with a greater shift. This method is referred to as a supershift assay, and is used to unambiguously identify a protein present in the protein-nucleic acid complex.\nOften, an extra lane is run with a competitor oligonucleotide to determine the most favorable binding sequence for the binding protein. The use of different oligonucleotides of defined sequence allows the identification of the precise binding site by competition (not shown in diagram). Variants of the competition assay are useful for measuring the specificity of binding and for measurement of association and dissociation kinetics.\nFor visualization purposes, the nucleic acid fragment is usually labeled with a radioactive, fluorescent or biotin label. Standard ethidium bromide staining is less sensitive than these methods and can lack the sensitivity to detect the nucleic acid if small amounts are used in these experiments. When using a biotin label, streptavidin conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase is used to detect the DNA fragment (Non-radioactive EMSA review)."}

Most sexually active men will be exposed to HPV at some time in their life. The types of HPV are often grouped into low and high risk according to their association with cancer.\nLow-risk HPV types such as 6 and 11 rarely cause cancer, but they can cause warts on or around the genitals. Men with penile cancer often report having a history of genital warts. High-risk HPV types are more likely to lead to cancer. In particular, HPV types 16 and 18 are linked to penile cancer. The exact role that these viruses play in the development of penile cancer is not clear.\nLack of Circumcision\nCircumcision removes all (or part) of the foreskin This procedure is most often done in infants, but it can be done later in life as well Men who are circumcised can\u2019t develop the condition called phimosis, and they don\u2019t accumulate material known as smegma\nPhimosis\nIn men who are not circumcised, the foreskin can sometimes become tight and difficult to retract Penile cancer is more common in men with phimosis Due to build-up of smegma or from inflammation that results from phimosis\nSmegma\nSecretions can build up underneath an intact foreskin If the area under the foreskin isn\u2019t cleaned well, these secretions build up enough to become a thick, odorous substance known as smegma Smegma is more common in men with phimosis Can occur in anyone with a foreskin if the foreskin isn't retracted regularly to clean the head of the penis It can irritate and inflame the penis eventually leading to penile carcinoma\nSmoking and other tobacco use\nTobacco users who have HPV infections have an even higher risk of developing\nUV light treatment for psoriasis\nTreated with drugs called psoralens and then an ultraviolet A (UVA) light source. This is called PUVA therapy To help lower this risk, men being treated with PUVA now have their genitals covered during treatment\nImmunocompromised states Poor genital hygiene"}

Variability in testing and data collection methods makes comparisons of prevalence and progression difficult. \nIn some areas, such as Japan, Singapore and Taiwan, up to 44% of the adult population is myopic.\nA recent study involving first-year undergraduate students in the United Kingdom found that 50% of British whites and 53.4% of British Asians were myopic. \nIn Australia, the overall prevalence of myopia (worse than \u22120.50 diopters) has been estimated to be 17%.  In one recent study, less than 1 in 10 (8.4%) Australian children between the ages of 4 and 12 were found to have myopia greater than \u22120.50 diopters.  A recent review found that 16.4% of Australians aged 40 or over have at least \u22121.00 diopters of myopia and 2.5% have at least \u22125.00 diopters. \nIn Brazil, a 2005 study estimated that 6.4% of Brazilians between the ages of 12 and 59 had \u22121.00 diopter or myopia or more, compared with 2.7% of the indigenous people in northwestern Brazil.  Another found nearly 1 in 8 (13.3%) of the students in one city were myopic. \nIn Greece, the prevalence of myopia among 15 to 18 year old students was found to be 36.8%. \nIn India, the prevalence of myopia in the general population has been reported to be only 6.9%.  \nA recent review found that 26.6% of Western Europeans aged 40 or over have at least \u22121.00 diopters of myopia and 4.6% have at least \u22125.00 diopters. \nIn the United States, the prevalence of myopia has been estimated at 20%. Nearly 1 in 10 (9.2%) American children between the ages of 5 and 17 have myopia.  Approximately 25% of Americans between the ages of 12 and 54 have the condition.  A recent review found that 25.4% of Americans aged 40 or over have at least \u22121.00 diopters of myopia and 4.5% have at least \u22125.00 diopters. \nA study of Jordanian adults aged 17 to 40 found that over half (53.7%) were myopic. \nThe prevalence of myopia in has been reported as high as 70-90% in some Asian countries, 30-40% in Europe and the United States and 10-20% in Africa.  Myopia is less common in black, Nubians, and Sudanese people. In Americans between the ages of 12 and 54, myopia has been found to affect whites less than blacks. . Asians had the highest prevalence (18.5%), followed by Hispanics (13.2%). Whites had the lowest prevalence of myopia (4.4%), which was not significantly different from African Americans (6.6%). For hyperopia, whites had the highest prevalence (19.3%), followed by Hispanics (12.7%). Asians had the lowest prevalence of hyperopia (6.3%) and were not significantly different from African Americans (6.4%). For astigmatism, Asians and Hispanics had the highest prevalences (33.6% and 36.9%, respectively) and did not differ from each other (P =.17). African Americans had the lowest prevalence of astigmatism (20.0%), followed by whites (26.4%) .\nA number of studies have shown that the prevalence of myopia increases with level of education   and many studies have shown a relationship between myopia and IQ. However, care must be taken in interpreting these results as correlation does not imply causation. According to Arthur Jensen, myopes average 7-8 IQ points higher than non-myopes. The relationship also holds within families, and siblings with a higher degree of refraction error average higher IQs than siblings with less refraction error. Jensen believes that this indicates myopia and IQ are pleiotropically related as they are caused or influenced by the same genes. The mechanism that has caused a relationship between myopia and IQ is not yet known with certainty."}

The electrocardiogram (ECG) registers these activities from these electrodes which have been attached on diffrent places on the body. In total, twelve leads are calculated using ten electrodes.\nThe ten electrodes are:\nthe extremity electrodes: LA - left arm RA - right arm N - neutral, on the right leg (= electrisch aarde of nulpunt ten opzichte waarvan de electrische spanning wordt gemeten) F - foot, on the left leg\nIt makes no difference whether the electrodes are attached proximal or distal on the extremities. However, it is best to be uniform in this. (eg. do not attach an electrode on the left shoulder and one on the right wrist).\n\nthe chest electrodes: V1 - placed in the 4th intercostal space, right of the sternum V2 - placed in the 4th intercostal space, left of the sternum V3 - placed between V2 and V4 V4 - placed 5th intercostal space in the nippleline. Official recommendations are to place V4 under the breast in women. Kligfield V5 - placed between V4 and V6 V6 - placed in the midaxillary line on the same height as V4 (horizontal line from V4, so not necessarily in the 5th intercostal space)\nUsing these 10 electrodes, 12 leads can be derived. There are 6 extremity leads and 6 precordial leads.\nThe extremity leads are:\nI from the right to the left arm II from the right arm to the left leg III from the left arm to the left leg\nAn easy rule to remember: lead I + lead III = lead II This is done with the use of the height or depth, independent of the wave (QRS, P of T). Example: if in lead I, the QrS complex is 3 mm in height and in lead III 9mm, the height of the QRS-complex in lead II is 12mm.\nOther extremity leads are:\nAVL points to the left arm AVR points to the right arm AVF points to the feet\nThe capital A stands for \"augmented\" and V for \"voltage\".\n(aVR + aVL + aVF = 0)\nThe precordial, or chest leads, (V1,V2,V3,V4,V5 and V6)'observe' the depolarization wave in the frontal plane\nExample: V1 is close to the right ventricle and the right atrium. Signals in these areas of the heart have the largest signal in this lead. V6 is the closest to the lateral wall of the left ventricle."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat association exists between abdominal pain and COVID-19?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "There are no established diagnostic criteria to identify the cause of abdominal pain among COVID-19 patient. COVID-19 associated abdominal pain is a symptom, not a disease. Abdominal pain may be a symptom of direct injury of an involved abdominal organ or merely one of the symptoms of COVID-19. Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, and blood tests demonstrating deranged liver functions can give a clue of possible gastrointestinal involvement.\nHistory of contact with a person suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection is important to suspect COVID-19 in a patient. Abdominal pain is itself a symptom. Based upon retrospective observational studies, a COVID-19 patient may have abdominal pain as an accompanying symptom along with other COVID-19 infection symptoms such as diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, cough, dyspnea and malaise.   Very few patients present with abdominal pain as the sole symptom and high suspicion is required in order to reach the diagnosis.  A retrospective observational study from Norway, described nine patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute abdominal pain as presenting symptom. The pain was localized as right iliac fossa, left iliac fossa, global, epigastric and umbilical pain.  A case of COVID-19 presenting with acute pancreatitis had severe epigastric pain along with fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dry cough and progressive dyspnea.  A case series of COVID-19 patients presenting with acute abdomen had sudden abdominal pain along with aforementioned accompanying GI symptoms.  Gradually progressive, generalized abdominal pain, moderate in severity has been described in a case report for COVID-19 presenting with hyponatraemia. \nPatients with abdominal pain associated with COVID-19 may appear in distress due to their general condition or the severity of abdominal pain. A person with pancreatitis will appear dehydrated, lethargic and in severe pain. Coffee ground gastric emesis indicates a possible upper GI bleed. \nPhysical examination may be remarkable for:\nVital signs:     Heart rate / Pulse: Tachycardia may be due to fever, pain or shock or anxiety. Blood pressure: Depending upon the cause of abdominal pain a patient with mild disease may have a normal blood pressure with other presenting with shock due to gut perforation and resulting sepsis. Respiratory rate: Tachypnea maybe due to high metabolic rate such as in fever and sepsis due to COVID-19 along with inefficient ventilation. Inefficient ventilation can be due to COVID-19 lung infection such as pneumonia or ARDS. Shallow breathing can be due to severe respiratory distress or abdominal pain. Temperature: The patient can be febrile due to COVID-19 infection, hypothermic, or have a normal temperature. On Abdominal exam:    Inspection: Cullen's sign indicates acute pancreatitis but it has not been reported among COVID-19 associated acute pancreatitis cases. Auscultation: Accompanying gastrointestinal infection may present as increased bowel sounds due to enteritis. Decreased bowel sounds or absent bowel sounds following a period of increased bowel sounds may indicate gut rupture. Palpation: Based of a few case reports generalized abdominal or epigastric tenderness or right iliac fossa tenderness may accompany the symptom sometimes presenting exactly as acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis. Guarding (muscles contract as pressure is applied), rigidity (rigid abdominal wall- indicates peritoneal inflammation), and rebound tenderness (release of pressure is associated with pain) may point towards peritonitis a complication of acute appendicitis, gut perforation or rarely pancreatitis. The sign is important in leading decision making regarding the patient's need for surgery. Murphy's sign is important in the diagnosis of cholecystitis which has been reported with COVID-19. Percussion: No significant findings associated with COVID-19 associated abdominal pain have been reported. The physical exam findings associated with COVID-19 can be viewed by clicking here.\nThere are no specific laboratory findings associated with abdominal pain among COVID-19 patients. Laboratory findings consistent with the presence of infectious virions in the GI or respiratory tract detected via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) indicate a possible direct viral infectivity of the respective organ.  Liver function tests: Biochemical markers of liver injury such as bilirubin, CRP, ALT, AST and Gamma GT may be elevated in blood tests depicting liver injury.  A meta-analysis found a higher risk of raised ALT and AST among patients with severe COVID-19.  Serum electrolyes: Such as sodium, potassium and magnesium may be normal among patients with COVID-19 but an important investigation to exclude life-threatening causes among patients presenting with abdominal pain. A case report demonstrated a patient with COVID-19 presenting with abdominal pain and hyponatremia was likely due to SIADH. Electrolytes become vital among such cases of COVID-19 associated abdominal pain.  Retrospective studies from Italy and China demonstrated an association between hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and COVID-19 due to degradation of ACE 2 loss, diuretic and corticosteroid use. Hypokalemia may lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. Close monitoring of serum electrolyte levels is essential specially in ICU patients.   Complete blood count: Provides information regarding the infectious status of the patient via leukocytosis such as in upper GI bleed and peritonitis, pancreatitis, or lymphocytes indicating viral infection.    CRP and procalcitonin: The value provides information on the inflammation and superimposed bacterial source of infection.  A case of COVID-19 presenting as acute pancreatitis reports elevated procalcitonin.  D-Dimer: Elevated serum levels has been reported in a case of perforated acute abdomen in a patient with COVID-19.  Serum amylase and lipase: Elevated serum levels demonstrate pancreatitis.  Renal function tests: Deranged in a dehydrated person (elevated urea) and patient with upper gastrointestinal bleeding or gut perforation as a complication of COVID-19 (elevated BUN and creatinine).  FOBT test: Reported to be found positive among patients with upper GI bleed.  Endocscopy: In a patient with upper GI bleed upper GI endoscopy may demonstrate esophageal ulcers and sample for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining can help detect the virus.  Some studies recommend evaluating the effectiveness of stool RT PCR for SARS-COV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 if initial nasopharyngeal RT PCR comes out negative in a case of high suspicion. \nThere are no ECG findings associated with COVID-19 associated abdominal pain. Studies suggest that up to 50% of the hospitalized acute pancreatitis patients have non-specific ST\u2013T segment changes on ECG. The changes that have been described include diffuse T-wave inversions (V4 - V6), ST-segment elevation of 2 mm, peaked upright T waves (V1 - V3) along with reciprocal changes in lead II and bizarre T waves in the limb leads.   COVID-19 associated acute pancreatitis has not been shown to demonstrate ECG abnormalities in the case reports. The electrocardiogram findings in COVID-19 can be viewed by clicking here.\nAn x-ray may be helpful in finding the cause of COVID-19 associated abdominal pain. Among patients with COVID-19 associated GI symptoms (abdominal pain was one of the symptoms), abdominal Xrays have been reported to be normal in a few studies available.   A Chest X-ray in a COVID-19 patient may be normal or demonstrates patchy or diffuse reticular\u2013nodular opacification and consolidation with basal and peripheral predominance bilaterally. Bilateral perihilar and interstitial opacities with air bronchograms have also been reported. These X-ray findings depict pulmonary disease COVID-19.  The signs are not related to abdominal pain directly. COVID-19 being primarily a pulmonary disease, the findings may serve as important tools to help strongly suspect COVID-19 even in the absence of RT PCR. A retrospective non-peer reviewed study reports the sensitivity of CXR to be 68% in detecting lung manifestations of COVID-19.  The x-ray findings in COVID-19 can be viewed by clicking here.\nUltrasound of the abdomen may be helpful in finding the cause of COVID-19 associated abdominal pain. Bowel inflammatory sign (peri-intestinal inflammatory reaction) has been reported in a patient with COVID-19 associated abdominal pain.  The echocardiographic findings in COVID-19 can be viewed by clicking here.\nCT scan may be helpful in finding the cause of COVID-19 associated abdominal pain. Peri-intestinal inflammatory reaction on abdominal CT scan of a patient with pancreatitis associated with COVID-19 has been reported.  In a case report, CT scan of abdomen demonstrated extensive pneumoperitoneum and CT scan of the chest demonstrated pneumothorax in a patient with gut perforation associated with COVID-19.  A retrospective observational study from Norway reported that among COVID-19 patients presenting with abdominal pain as their chief complaint, the CT scan chest demonstrated ground-glass opacities.  The CT scan findings in COVID-19 can be viewed by clicking here.\n\nThere are no MRI findings associated with COVID-19 associated abdominal pain. The MRI findings in COVID-19 can be viewed by clicking here.\nIn a case series, based on their experience, Poggiali et al. strongly recommend bedside lung ultrasound to detect the signs of respiratory COVID-19 infection even when there are no respiratory symptoms."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCan you provide a brief overview of tuberous sclerosis?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "TSC can be first diagnosed at any stage of life and it is diagnosed if a set of diagnostic criteria are met. If a case meets the clinical diagnostic criteria, then it is performed a genetic molecular testing which is seem mostly as corroborative. The latest diagnostic criteria was developed by the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference.\nThe most common symptoms of tuberous sclerosis are due to the growth of the already disclosed benign tumors. Tumors in the CSN may cause epilepsy, autism and children may also present with cognitive disabilities. Tumors in the kidneys may compromise renal function and metastasize to the lungs, which in most cases is asymptomatic.\nSkin lesions are present and they are usually remarkable for dental enamel pits (present in 100% of the patients), hypomelanotic macules, shagreen patches, and forehead plaques.\nThere are no typical diagnostic laboratory findings associated with tuberous sclerosis. Patients may present with elevated BUN or creatinine if their renal angiomyolipomas compromise renal function or if they also present with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.\nThere are no ECG findings associated with tuberous sclerosis.\nThere are no typical x-ray findings associated with tuberous sclerosis, but patients may present with pneumothorax and/or chylous pleural effusions due if they develop lymphangioleiomyomatosis.\nEchocardiography / ultrasound may be helpful raising the suspicion of tuberous sclerosis. Echocardiographs can detect cardiac rhabdomyomas, present in more than 80% of the children with TSC. Ultrasound can detect hepatic angiomyolipomas, renal angiomyolipomas (present in 55-75% of patients) and renal cysts (present in 18-55% of the patients).\nCT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. It can diagnose cortical or subependymal tubers and white matter abnormalities, subependymal hamartomas, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, renal angiomyolipomas, renal cysts, renal cell carcinoma (associated with tuberous sclerosis), retroperitoneal lymphangiomyomatosis, gastrointestinal polyps, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia and cardiac rhabdomyomas.\nMRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis as it can find the same abnormalities found on CT scan which are described above, some of them with much more detail, but it is especially useful for evaluating white matter changes seen in the disease.\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with tuberous sclerosis.\nGenetic testing may be helpful in the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis but some patients may not have detectable genetic mutations on the test and still have the disease. It is considered to be a corroborative test."}

What could be wrong?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms seem to be just pure anxiety. It is normal to feel your heart beat through your stomach, when you are resting (the heart beat vibrations are transmitted through the diaphragm, and you can experience the feeling of a heart beat in the stomach). This is certainly more obvious in sensitive persons. Regarding the numbness and chest discomfort, I would recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a cardiac ultrasound (to examine better your cardiac function) and a chest x-ray. The face numbness (including the neck and left arm) may be also a sign of a neurological disorder. A neurological consult, coupled with a cervical spine x-ray study are needed to exclude any nerve compression. Some blood lab tests like (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, etc.) should be done for the exclusion of possible metabolic causes, contributing in this symptomatology.

So you do not need to worry about your wives pregnancy from the medication the doctor prescribed. However, to properly treat a urine infection the dosing of the medication is typically 500 mg three or four times daily rather than just twice. If your wife completes the medication and her next urine test still shows white blood cells (plus) it should be cultured for bacteria to make sure that the infection is gone, because this dose of septum is frequently not strong enough to properly treat the infection, even in a pregnant woman. So in summary, it certainly is safe to take the prescribed medication for your wife during the pregnancy, and her doctor should consider increasing the dose if the suspected urine infection does not resolve within a few days. I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,"}

Multiple endocrine neoplasia occurs when tumors are found in at least two endocrine glands. Tumors can also develop in organs and tissues other than endocrine glands. If the tumors become cancerous, some cases can be life-threatening. The disorder affects 1 in 30,000 people.\nAlthough many different types of hormone-producing tumors are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, tumors of the parathyroid gland, pituitary gland, and pancreas are most frequent in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tumors cause an overactivation of these hormone-producing glands, leading to serious health problems such as severe ulcers. Overactivity of the parathyroid gland (hyperparathyroidism) is the most common sign of this disorder. Hyperparathyroidism disrupts the normal balance of calcium in the blood, which can lead to kidney stones, thinning of bones, weakness, and fatigue.\nNeoplasia in the pituitary gland can manifest as prolactinomas whereby too much prolactin is secreted, suppressing the release of gonadotropins, causing a decrease in sex hormones such as testosterone.\nPancreatic tumors usually form in the islet cells, which over-secrete insulin, causing a decrease in blood glucose levels."}

Another possible finding is a systolic ejection murmur at the aortic site without radiation to the carotids that decreases with squatting or handgrip maneuvers signifying the possible presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Assessment of auditory acuity is important since some form of loss of hearing can be seen in some patients (10% have low frequency deficits, 25% have high frequency deficits) Signs of heart failure including pulmonary congestion, increased JVD, and edema should be noted.\nFacial features are notable for large head with tall and prominent forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, and wide and depressed nasal root.\nSkin abnormalities including multiple pigmented nevi, caf\u00e9 au lait spots, keratosis pilaris of upper arms and face and lentigines can be seen although not very common.\nSigns of lymphatic obstruction are very common especially neck webbing with prominence of the trapezius.\nShort stature is common in Noonan syndrome especially during puberty since pubertal growth is usually delayed. However, adult height can often be normal.\nDelayed onset of puberty can be seen in some patients with at least one third entering pubertal age after 13. Assessment for cryptorchidism is important since at least 80% of males have unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism.\nSigns of thrombocytopenia or coagulation defects can be seen in about half of the patients presenting with easy bruising or bleeding.\nPeripheral lymphedema can be seen in 20% of patients.\nSkeletal abnormalities are detectable in many patients with Noonan syndrome particularly spiny deformities and chest deformities like pectus carinatum and pectus excavatum usually also associated with widely spaced nipples.\nOcular findings are found in 95% of patients including ptosis, strabismus, amblyopia, nystagmus, refractive errors, and cataracts."}

I am Chat Doctor answering your query. The pain in your stomach immediately after Chat Doctor.  The dull pain on the right side of your abdomen could be due to anything ranging from inflammation of the liver to an infection in the gall bladder, and more so could be due to a developing inflammation in the pancreas which is very common in those who consume alcohol. The extent of damage to any of these organs could be judged by a clinical examination by a physician along with related investigations for liver and pancreas like LFT, serum amylase, serum lipase, and an ultrasound/CT scan of the abdomen. Management would depend on the reports of these investigations. However, it is not known why you indulge in alcohol inspire of knowing that it could damage your liver, and other organs as well. The main treatment of your condition is total abstinence from alcohol, and this only your strong determination could do, and no one else.

Sensation of pain and discomfort after eating food is characteristic. An Ultrasound scan of Abdomen & upper GI endoscopy will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis. Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals). They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief. And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1.

Several potential genetic abnormalities have been identified:\nThe gene that encodes for alpha-dystrobrevin . This is a dystrophin-associated protein which has been mapped to chromosome 18q12. The role of this protein is to preserve the structural integrity of the muscle membrane. An X-linked genetic defect which involves a mutation in the gene G4.5 (TAZ) of the Xq28 chromosome region (a gene which encodes for tafazzin), the same region of the chromosome involved in several myopathies with cardiac involvement are located. These include Barth syndrome , Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, and myotubular myopathy. As a result, some patients with NCC may have features of Barth syndrome. Mutations of the ryanodine receptor 2 gene (RyR2) as has been seen in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Deletions of the FKBP12 gene result in noncompaction in the mouse . Knockout of the Peg1 gene has been associated with NCC in the mouse . LMNA mutations Abnormalities of transcription factors such as NKX2.5 and TBX5. Abnormalities of 11p15 as suggested in a GWAS analysis. 22q11 deletion Distal 5q deletion involving the CSX gene"}

I can understand your concern. PSP is progressive supra nuclear palsy. It is cerebral disease. And this can cause diminished gag reflex. So possibility of aspiration is high in such patients. Your patient is also having coughing during eating and Chat Doctor.  This is suggestive of aspiration more. So your patient is at high risk of aspiration pneumonia.

In 1996, I had 2 thoracic surgeries due to cryptococcal pneumonia. I lost my upper left lobe of my lung cavity. Ten days later had to have a pericardium graft to seal my lower left lobe that the pneumonia had begun to damage. I took several rounds of diflucan antibiotics till my blood cell counts returned to normal. I m currently being seen by pulmonary specialist who feels that this mass is a result of scar tissue. Over past year I have noticed changes with my pain level, night sweats, shortness of breath, etc. anxiety / stress causes my chest to constrict as if a boa constrictor is squeezing the breath out of me. By having the 2 surgeries I lost 4 of my 5th left rib when I was only to loose 4cm! In the beginning my doctor diagnosed my situation as being scar tissue, another physician referred to it as a left hilar mass, now they refer to it as a mediastinal mass. I m scheduled for a pft test this week & have had chest X-ray last march, followed by cat scan w/ contrast last April ,& finally a cat scan this past Friday but contrast couldn t be used because after 8 attempts to have an IV contrast was cancelled.

Q- What's the difference-Ans-NO practical difference, but in your case-it has different meaning-like-you mostly have extensive -radio-opaque mass-in mediastinum, indicating extensive lung lesion spreading to mediastinum also. Only possibility of care and cure -is by antifungal medicines. & chances of my recovery-are grim in your case. But see if you get benefits from antifungal medicines.

As per your complaint a purple blotch over gums on teeth can be a bruise caused by some injury to the gums and toothbrush bristles can be one of the most common cause of injury to the gums, or it can be due to some hard food like chips that can cause injury to the gums and rupture of small blood vessels can cause blood accumulation below the soft tissues leading to formations of red to purple bruises. As it is not painful there and is localized to only front three teeth you need not worry as gradually it will resolve on its own. In case if it spreads or there is pain in the area you should consult a dentist to get ruled out for infection in the gums or teeth. As of now there is nothing to worry as nothing seems serious.

If she already had an open-heart surgery, opening the chest again for redo surgery will be definitely risky and will be more difficult as compared with the previous surgery. But it is not impossible and is being routinely done. It depends on the probability of life expectancy with disease and after surgery. If there is not much difference, we keep the patient on medical management. AF has a risk of clot formation which requires blood thinners to prevent clot formation.

On urine examination, cellular casts and proteinuria can be found in SLE while only proteinuria is seen in Eclampsia. SLE is associated with decreasing levels of complement and incresing titre of anti-dsDNA. Also, a history of previous SLE and onset of symptoms before 20 weeks points towards lupus and a renal biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis although it is genereally not recommended during pregnancy. Acute adrenal insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency can present with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, loss of appetite, headache, abdominal pain, confusion, loss of consciousness, abnormal body movements, or coma, also seen in eclampsia. Adrenal insufficiency will present with hypotension, whereas eclampsia is associated with high blood pressure. Also, AI patients may have a history of chronic use of steroids for diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.  Patients may present with symptoms only in the postpartum period as during pregnancy they may acquire cortisol transplacentally from the fetus.  Diagnostic tests show decreased morning basal serum cortisol, decreased salivary free cortisol, not seen in eclampsia. Further cosyntropin test and basal ACTH levels can be done. Imaging (MRI without gadolinium administration should be done in pregnant women) may show a pituitary tumor or a cranial SOL. Brain tumor(s) Brain tumor often presents with signs of raised Intracranial pressure, such as headache, nausea, vomiting and seizures, also seen in eclampsia. Commom tumors that can be found are meningiomas , pituitary tumors, gliomas, etc. Presence of past history of convulsions and absence of hypertension and proteinuria points towards cerebral pathology. Brain tumour may present with partial or localized seizures rather than GTCS and can have localized symptoms, such as visual disturbances in pituitary adenomas, localized sensory or motor changes, etc which could differentiate it from eclampsia. Also, brain imaging such as MRI can help establish the diagnosis. Intracranial Haemorrhage / Ruptured Brain Aneurysm On physical exam, history and diagnostic test, ICH demonstrates headache, nausea and vomiting, vision abnormalities(such as blurring, scotomas, diminished vision), seizures, loss of consciousness also observed in Eclampsia. The headache in ICH is often described as the worst headache of life. Presence of symptoms such as stiffness of neck, sensitivity to light, unilateral drooping of eyelid, unilateral symptoms of stroke(sensory or motor weakness), and absence of proteinuria, oliguria, edema, gestational hypertension differentiates its from Eclampsia. Neuroimaging (CT or MRI brain) will show AV malformation, ruptured blood vessel, blood in the subarachnoid space that distinguish it from Eclampsia. Disseminated herpes simplex/ Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE) On physical exam and history Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE) may present with Headache, Seizures(seen in 50% of cases ), vision abnormalities, confusion, hyperactivity also observed in eclampsia. On physical exam and history Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE) demonstrates high fever, stiff neck, altered reflexes, drowsiness with stupor, localised symptoms such as aphasia, anosmia that distinguish it from eclampsia. Also, skin lesions in dermatomal distribution, immunocompromised status, retinitis points towards HSE. Detection of DNA or Zoster Antigen in CSF and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on CSF confirms infection with HSV. Treatment with antivirals (acyclovir) results in dramatic improvement. Drug overdose/ Drug Intoxication On physical exam and history drug intoxication can present with Seizures, Hypertension, nausea and vomiting also observed in eclampsia. The most common drugs accountable for seizures include Antidepressants, Diphenhydramine, Stimulants (Cocaine, Methamphetamines) Tramadol, and isoniazid.  Careful history and past records will indicate if the patient is taking any recreational or prescriptional medication respectively that could lead to overdose. Other symptoms of preeclampsia like proteinuria, edema are generally absent. Urine drug screening and Blood screening will confirm the diagnosis. Drug Withdral Syndromes Drug Withdral Symptoms are precipitated by sudden absence of a drug from one's system after development of physiological dependence on the drug. They could include Hypertesnion, tremors, seizures(GTCS), agitation, nausea and vomiting, also seen in eclampsia. Common responsible agents include, Short acting opoids (such as Heroin, some painkillers), Long acting opoids (eg. methadone), benzodiazepines(eg. clonazepam, Xanax), Alcohol. Presence of past history of drug intake, and symptoms like anxiety, insomnia, hallucinations, Psychological disturbances, Diarrhea (Benzodiazepines), Delerium Tremens (alcohol withdrawal), frequent yawning, goosebumps, body aches(opioids) point towards drug withdrawal. A urine drug screen helps confirm the diagnosis. Encephalitis Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, is most often caused by viral infection , presents with seizures in 2-67% of cases , and headache also seen in eclampsia. On history and physical exam a patient with Encephalitis demonstrates: fever, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, increased drowsiness, confusion and disorientation, irritability, anxiety and if severe: weakness, partial paralysis, double vision, impaired speech or hearing, coma, psychosis, hallucinations, etc. often not seen in eclampsia. Neuroimaging (brain MRI or CT scan), PCR or a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is performed to check for signs of infection. Eg. if the cause is viral, the CSF will show: moderately elevated protein (60-80 mg/dL), normal glucose, and a moderate pleocytosis (up to 1000 leukocytes /\u00b5L)(Mononuclear cells usually predominate). Blood, urine and stool tests to look for organisms or antibodies responsible for an infection often helps establish diagnosis. Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) On history and physical exam AFLP demonstrates nausea and vomiting (seen in 50-60%), abdominal pain (50-60%), edema, mental status changes (altered sensorium, confusion, disorientation, psychosis, restlessness, seizures or coma) (60\u201380%), tachycardia (50%) also seen in eclampsia.  Presence of Disseminated intravascular coagulation (55% cases), jaundice (>70%), gastrointestinal bleeding (seen in 20\u201360% cases), acute renal failure (seen in 50% cases), Oliguria (seen in 40\u201360% cases), fever(late onset)  and absence of hypertension, proteinuria differentiates it from eclampsia. Abdominal pain is usually right upper quadrant, midepigastric or radiating to back in AFLP(seen in 50-60% cases)  and mostly epigastric and non radiating in eclampsia. Severe coagulopathy such as disseminated intravascular coagulation is rare in pre-eclampsia but the prevalance is 55% in AFLP.  Lab tests in AFLP shows raised, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, elevated ammonia, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and hypofibrinogenemia if DIC is present, which differentiates it from eclampsia."}

I ve not any type of accident, my blood pressure is normal?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi Thanks for your query and Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. There are many causes of swelling in the legs. Most common reason is postural, and many patients develop it when they stand for a long time, but as soon as they elevate their leg up, the swelling subsides. It can happen after any injury which is a priority to diagnose and treat accordingly. Also, there could be infection or inflammation which can lead to swelling. Sometimes heavy physical activity may also lead to swelling in your calf muscles. But we have to look at medical causes as well, chronic cardiac conditions can lead to swelling, any pathology which leads to low proteins in the body like deranged LFT, KFT etc. can also lead to swelling. Hypothyroidism can also lead to generalized swelling like appearance in the body.Also, red discoloration can be due to inflammatory/ infective pathology, or it also is died to an underlying vascular cause but unless a thorough physical examination is done, no comment about the etiology of your condition can be made. For accurate diagnosis we also need to clinically evaluate and get appropriate tests :CBC, ESR, CRP, LFT, FT, Serum Electrolytes and Thyroid profile. Please get back to me should you need more information or with test results.  Do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further assistance. You can also discuss your case and treatment plans with me in a greater detail in a private consultation. Thanks & Regards"}

The pain is way worse now then when I was 17, could be that I ve raised three children since then! If it weren t for my children, I wouldn t be here right now - everything I do is painful, exhausting, and depressing.... The way I explain my unrelenting pain to some people has been telling them that just because I m smiling today doesn t mean that I am not in pain, doesn t mean every single joint, muscle etc... isn t driving me mad, every second of every minute of every hour of every day etc... and that I m a good actress when I need to be! I also explain my situation this way: if I were a dog, that felt all of the above...would you not have it put down so it wouldn t have to suffer one more horrible/painful minute? I ve been very careful not raise my pain meds (I just try to increase for a while, then decrease to the initial dosage etc...) I m trying to keep the dosages low (and not getting much relief) because of all the hoopla and the abuse of pain meds lately in both Canada and the US. Drs. now afraid to write higher dosage scripts for fear that the gov t will come down on them, and then before you know it, I will be stuck in the middle and have to try something else etc... The problem is I am in so much pain all the time, (even my pain Dr. told me that I will probably never not be completely pain free. I understand that I need to enjoy reduction in pain no matter how small or for how long... I see him every week to pick up my prescriptions but what makes the hour long (hard, painful, tiring) drive to see him worth it, is the Nerve Blocking Injections in my back, shoulders, and neck areas! (where were these injections 20-30 years ago?) I feel really good and abnormally energetic for a day or two after the injections, then it stops working, but I do appreciate the one or two days - very much! So, my first question is: along with my daily dose (2400mg of Gabapentin), should I stop worrying so much about the actual dosages and just keep raising it over time until I start to feel better, then level off? Right now I am on: 6mg 3x/day of extended release morphine, oxycodone 10mg 3x/day and cyclobenzaprine 10mg 2x/day. My second question is: How safe are these injections over time? Can I just keep getting them every week, after week for years? Thank you for your time, Diana\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Ok, the top question I do not see the milligram of gabapentin. 800 mg three times a day is the usual top dose. However, a key point on medications is the dose dependence of bad things happening. The relationship between Chat Doctor. Gabapentin is extremely LOW RISK, HIGH SAFETY, but, its side effect curve (sleepiness) is weird in that it starts at about 1 in three people at the low dose having sleepiness and it doesn't really change much with higher dosing. Bad stuff doesn't seem to happen with much higher doses as opposed to most things (like water) where going up 3 to 5-fold is dangerous. Flexeril is dangerous above the recommended dose which is the MAXIMUM SAFE DOSE. It affects muscle including heart. Bad. Narcotics are the more usual case. Low low doses don't do much. Average doses have some risks and some help. Going above the recommended dose increases both some pain relief but vastly increases the danger of stopping breathing, addiction, etc. Cant say about the back injections because I do not know what is injected. Steroids would typically stick in any space they are put into for weeks not days, but this depends on if it is steroids injected and what type of steroid. Lidocaine wouldn't last as long but its quite safe except for the needle which can hit something each time. Steroids in theory weaken muscle, tendon, bone, but I've never seen anyone who's gotten 10 injections in their entire lives so, I cannot comment on actual problems. The near 100% risk of local minor bruising and local pain and significant risk of spinal fluid leak with spinal injections are the biggest risk (of minor seriousness). Back muscle injections....the injections themselves are really close to zero risk; we do antibiotic shots daily. Thousands. Not much risk. Oh, wait flu shots. Tens of thousands. Not much risk."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhich laboratory results suggest radiation damage?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The diagnosis of ARS can be difficult to make because ARS causes no unique disease. Also, depending on the dose, the prodromal stage may not occur for hours or days after exposure, or the patient may already be in the latent stage by the time they receive treatment, in which case the patient may appear and feel well when first assessed.\nIf a patient received more than 0.05 Gy (5 rads) and three or four CBCs are taken within 8 to 12 hours of the exposure, a quick estimate of the dose can be made (see Ricks, et. al. for details). If these initial blood counts are not taken, the dose can still be estimated by using CBC results over the first few days. It would be best to have radiation dosimetrists conduct the dose assessment, if possible.\nIf a patient is known to have been or suspected of having been exposed to a large radiation dose, draw blood for CBC analysis with special attention to the lymphocyte count, every 2 to 3 hours during the first 8 hours after exposure (and every 4 to 6 hours for the next 2 days). Observe the patient during this time for symptoms and consult with radiation experts before ruling out ARS.\nIf no radiation exposure is initially suspected, you may consider ARS in the differential diagnosis if a history exists of nausea and vomiting that is unexplained by other causes. Other indications are bleeding, epilation, or white blood count (WBC) and platelet counts abnormally low a few days or weeks after unexplained nausea and vomiting. Again, consider CBC and chromosome analysis and consultation with radiation experts to confirm diagnosis."}

Physicians began to report that cases of herpes zoster were often followed by chickenpox in the younger people who lived with the shingles patients. The idea of an association between the two diseases gained strength when it was shown that lymph from a sufferer of herpes zoster could induce chickenpox in young volunteers.

Viral bronchitis is more common than bacterial bronchitis. These infections may be associated with additional symptoms such as headaches, fatigue. Additional symptoms such as ear ache, sore throat, decreased appetite. You may want to consider the use of bucolic agents. These would help to reduce the thickness of the secretions so that it can be expelled easier. Examples are bipolar, guaifenesin, Mucomyst use of an analgesic would help with the headache. Paracetamol can be used. Rest and the use of enough fluids would also be important. I hope this helps"}

B-cells are white blood cells present in the blood which are responsible for humoral response of the body to any infection. Humoral response is the production of antibodies which are specific to the pathogen causing infection and these antibodies attach themselves to the pathogen causing its death. Antibodies are usually immunoglobulins (IG). There are 5 types of Immunoglobulins in our body. Egg, IGA, IGM, IGE and ID. If there is a B-cell deficiency, there will be low levels of Immunoglobulins produced.IL-2, 4 and 6 are factors which are called cytokines which modulate the cell differentiation and hence affect the cell mediated immunity. Deficiency of these factors may cause depletion of both B cells and T cells. Thanks"}

The P-1 preventative study demonstrated that tamoxifen can prevent breast cancer in high-risk individuals. The relative risk reduction was up to 50% of new breast cancers, though the cancers prevented were more likely estrogen-receptor positive (this is analogous to the effect of finasteride on the prevention of prostate cancer, in which only low-grade prostate cancers were prevented).   Aromatase inhibitors and inactivators Risk-reducing mastectomy: Bilateral prophylactic mastectomies have been shown to prevent breast cancer in high-risk individuals, such as patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations.

This can lead to death from hypoxia and hypoxemia within a short period of time. Exacerbation of cardiopulmonary conditions: Hemolytic anemia can result in high-output cardiac failure, which refers to the inability of the circulatory system to meet the demands of exercising tissue, despite a high cardiac output. Hemolytic anemia can also exacerbate lung disease, since the capillary beds in the pulmonary circulation function to load oxygen onto hemoglobin for delivery to tissue beds. Exacerbation of neurologic conditions: Hemolytic anemia can contribute to cerebrovascular disease, or strokes, since the brain requires oxygen for survival of neurons. Myocardial infarction: Myocardial infarction, or heart attack, occurs if the anemia is severe such that the oxygen-carrying capacity is reduced to the coronary tissue. For this reason, patients with coronary artery disease should be transfused packed red blood cells if hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dl, compared to the conventional threshold of 7 g/dl for the general population. Transfusion dependence: This occurs when a patient requires repeated transfusions with packed red blood cells in order to maintain hemoglobin within an acceptable range, such as greater than 7 g/dl. Complications of transfusion include: Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)  For this reason, a restricted transfusion strategy is preferred over a liberal strategy.  Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)  Iron overload, or hemosiderosis Transfusion reaction due to ABO blood group incompatibility"}

CT colonography replaces X-ray films in the double contrast barium enema with a special computed tomography scan and requires special workstation software in order for the radiologist to interpret. This technique is approaching colonoscopy in sensitivity for polyps. However, any polyps found must still be removed by standard colonoscopy. \nCancer cells in the body grow rapidly, so they absorb the radioactive sugar fluorodeoxyglucose or FDG used in positron emission tomography (PET). The location and extent of the tumor mass can be determined using a PET scan. Also, metastatic lesions and their locations can be assessed using a PET scan. PET scans are evolving as a very useful modality for staging and assessment of colorectal cancers. PET-CT scan has the advantage tissue based resolution and is useful in detecting whole body metastasis.\nFirst, an overnight preparation is taken to cleanse the colon. An enema containing barium sulfate is administered, then air is insufflated into the colon, distending it. The result is a thin layer of barium over the inner lining of the colon which is visible on X-ray films. A cancer or a precancerous polyp can be detected this way. This technique can miss the (less common) flat polyp. Barium study can be used to delineate the lesion preoperatively."}

For diagnosing pulmonary TB clinical (patients presentation symptoms and signs), radiological (Chest x-ray, high resolution CT appearance), microbiological (sputum AFB, sputum CBN AAT testing) findings need to be correlated.  The common symptoms suggestive of TB are cough for more than 2 weeks duration not subsiding with routine antibiotics, fever with evening rise in temperature, bloody sputum (hemoptysis), loss of appetite n loss of weight.  Did your friend have any of these symptoms ? If yes then definitely investigations to rule out or rule in TB have to be proceeded with. Also, two things need to be kept in mind.  One, not always chest x-ray show some abnormality in TB.  If there is minimal lesion then only a HRCT chest can pick it up, and it can be missed on chest x-ray.  Two, Since TB is common in India, at times, other diseases are wrongly diagnosed to be TB. Hence, it's essential that you get the consultation with a qualified physician to ensure that diagnosis is correctly arrived at.  As far as the treatment for TB is concerned, if this is the first time your friend is taking anti-TB medications then he/she has to take it for 6 months.  If this is second time then the course will be for 8 months"}

It usually involves the epidermis, but occasionally extends into the underlying dermis. It has predilection for apocrine gland -bearing areas: mostly the perineum, vulva, axilla, scrotum and penis. Extramammary Paget's disease may be classified into two groups based on the origin of the Paget's cells. Extramammary Paget's disease may be classified into four subtypes based on site of origin and area affected. On gross pathology, plaque with an irregular border and erythematous or white lesion are characteristic findings of extramammary Paget's disease. On microscopic histopathological analysis, the presence of Paget's cells (large cells with abundant amphophilic or basophilic, finely granular cytoplasm and a large, centrally-located nucleus and prominent nucleolus) and signet ring cells are characteristic findings of extramammary Paget's disease. Extramammary Paget's disease is usually associated with adnexal apocrine carcinoma, which represents infiltration of the deeper adnexa by epidermal Paget cells. Neither the direct cause nor a prominent risk factor of extramammary Paget's disease has been identified. Extramammary Paget's disease is rare and the exact incidence is unknown. Extramammary Paget's disease commonly affects individuals 50-60 years of age. Females are more commonly affected with the disease than males. The female to male ratio is approximately 3-4.5 to 1. It usually affects individuals of the Caucasian race, but it may occur in other races. Symptoms of extramammary Paget's disease include pruritis, vulvar pain, vulvar bleeding, and burning sensation. Biopsy is diagnostic of extramammary Paget's disease. Other diagnostic studies for extramammary Paget's disease include fine needle aspirate and PAP smear. Treatment depends on the stage at diagnosis. Treatment often includes surgery and chemotherapy with either 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, or combination of paclitaxel and trastuzumab."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCan you provide a summary of Urticaria?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "There are numerous mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible in pathogenesis of urticaria. One of the prominent urticaria pathogenesis seems to be inflammatory processes due to increased immune cells activity. Basophils, mast cells, macrophages, neutrophils and T cells are some of the most common immune cells known to be responsible in pathogenesis of urticaria. Among them, basophils and mast cells have more eminent role in urticaria development and their activation has been related to some intracellular signal defect and/or autoimmune disorders. Some immunoglobins, such as IgE have been detected in patients suffering from urticaria. For instance, IgE anti- IL-24 is one of these IgE autoantigens that have been found in all patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. Moreover, complement system is also responsible in pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria and role of some complements, such as C3, C4 and C5 have been established. Based on numerous studies, urticaria patients may have some genetical changes. Upregulation of 506 genes and downregulation of 51 genes have been reported in the affected skin with chronic spontaneous urticaria. Most of the upregulated genes were involve in adhesion (such as SELE (1q24)), cell activation (such as CD69), and chemotaxis (such as CCL2). It is crystal clear that urticaria is associated with autoimmune diseases such as hashimoto's thyroiditis. Other associations are mastocytisis such as urticaria pigmentosa, atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, hay fever and allergic asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus and angioedema."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat exactly is an aortic aneurysm?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The aortic aneurysms are a multifactorial disease associated with genetic and environmental risk factors. Marfan's syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with the disease, but there are also rarer syndromes like the Loeys-Dietz syndrome that are associated as well. Even in patients that do not have genetic syndromes, it has been observed that genetics can also play a role on aortic aneurysms' development. There has been evidence of genetic heterogeneity as there has already been documented in intracranial aneurysms.  The genetic alterations associated with these genetic syndromes are the following:\nGenetic diseases associated with aortic aneurysms  Disease Involved Cellular Pathway Mutated Gene(s) Affected Protein(s) Ehlers-Danlos type IV syndrome Extracellular Matrix Proteins COL3A1 Collagen type III Marfan's Syndrome Extracellular Matrix Proteins FBN1 Fibrillin-1 Loeys-Dietz syndrome TGF-\u03b2 Pathway TGFBR1 / TGFBR2 Aneurysm-Osteoarthritis Syndrome SMAD3 SMAD3 Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Ciliopathy PKD1/PKD2 Polycystin 1 Polycystin 2 Turner Syndrome Meiotic Error with Monosomy, Mosaicism, or De Novo Germ Cell Mutation 45X 45XO Partial or Complete Absence of X Chromosome Bicuspid Aortic Valve with TAA Neural Crest Migration NOTCH1 Notch 1 Familial TAA Smooth Muscle Contraction Proteins ACTA2 \u03b1-Smooth Muscle Actin Familial TAA with Patent Ductus Arteriosus Smooth Muscle Contraction Proteins MYH11 Smooth Muscle Myosin Familial TAA Smooth Muscle Contraction Proteins MYLK Myosin Light Chain Kinase Familial TAA Smooth Muscle Contraction Proteins PRKG1 Protein Kinase c-GMP Dependent, type I Loeys-Dietz Syndrome variants TGF-\u03b2 Pathway TGF-\u03b2R1 TGF-\u03b2R2 SMAD3 TGF-\u03b22 TGF-\u03b23\nThese genetic diseases mostly affect either the synthesis of extracellular matrix protein or damage the smooth muscle cells both important component's of the aortic wall. Injury to any of these components lead to weakening of the aortic wall and dilation - resulting in aneurysm formation.\nThe aorta is the largest vessel of the body, but it is not homogenous. Its upper segment is composed by a larger proportion of elastin in comparison to collagen, therefore being more distensible. The lower segment has a larger proportion of collagen, therefore it is less distensible. It is also where most of the atherosclerotic plaques of the aorta are located.  Historically it was thought that abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms were caused by the same etiology: atherosclerotic degeneration of the aortic wall, but recently it has been theorized that they are indeed different diseases. \nThe aortic arch mostly derives from the neural crest cell which differentiate into smooth muscle cells. These smooth muscle cells are probably more adapted to remodel the thoracic aorta and manage the higher pulse pressure and ejection volume due to increased production of elastic lamellae during development and growth.  The abdominal aorta remains with cells of mesodermal origin, which are more similar to that of the original primitive arterial. That difference results in the neural crest cell precursors of the thoracic aorta being able to respond differently to various cytokines and growth factors than the mesodermal precursors of the abdominal aorta,  such as homocysteine  and angiotensin II. \nWhen neural crest vascular smooth muscle cells are treated with TGF-\u03b2 they demonstrate increased collagen production, while mesodermal vascular smooth muscle cell did not.  Not coincidently, mutations of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor can cause thoracic aortic aneurysm but do not cause abdominal aortic ones.\nThe thoracic and abdominal aorta are very structurally different. While they both have three layers: intimal, medial and adventitia, the media of the thoracic aorta is comprised of approximately 60 units divided into vascular and avascular regions. The abdominal aorta consists of about 30 units and is entirely avascular, being dependent on trans-intimal diffusion of nutrients for its smooth muscle cells to survive.  It is believed that both differences explain why the abdominal aorta is more likely to form aneurysms.\nThe development of aortic aneurysms is defined by: inflammation: infiltration of the vessel wall by lymphocytes and macrophage; extracellular matrix damage: destruction of elastin and collagen by proteases (also metalloproteinases) in the media and adventitia; cellular damage: loss of smooth muscle cells with thinning of the media; and insufficient repair: neovascularization."}

There are two ways of doing this with a placenta praevia:\nThe baby's head can be brought down to the placental site (if necessary with Willet's forceps or a vulsellum) and a weight attached to his scalp A leg can be brought down and the baby's buttocks used to compress the placental site\nThe goal of this type of delivery is to save the mother, and both methods will often kill the baby. These methods were used for many years before Ceasarean section and saved the lives of both mothers and babies with this condition.\nThe main risk with a vaginal delivery with a praevia is that as you are trying to bring down the head or a leg, you might separate more of the placenta and increase the bleeding.\nPlacenta praevia increases the risk of puerperal sepsis and postpartum haemorrhage because the lower segment to which the placenta was attached contracts less well post-delivery."}

Large tumor size at presentation (typically >5 cm) has been the most consistently determined adverse prognostic factor. Other reported factors include tumor grade, truncal location, surgical margin status, local recurrence, and heterologous rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. The true prognostic impact of NF1 syndrome in MPNST remains somewhat in flux. Several large series report significantly worse outcomes for MPNST arising in the setting of NF1 compared with sporadic disease, with inferior responses to cytotoxic chemotherapy and 5-year survivals that are up to 50% worse."}

My age is 26. when i feel  pain and urinilar problem (like drop drop urin) consulted with a urologist. He suggested the tests 1. Urin R/M/E 2. Urine for C/S 3. S.Creatinine 4. USG of KUB region+ MCC and PVR-2D. After getting the report i found 1st 3 were in normal range but the last one is not satisfactory. the reports shows :a ) Mild Obstructive features in both kidneys. b)Hyperechoic mass in left adnexal region (? Ovarian dermoid) . I m too tensed. my doctor then suggested me abt CT scan of kidneys. but my concern is should i step forward to this big test just for this report? as far i know CIty scan is not good for health. then verbally i consult with a doctor he suggested abt IVU test. u can see that i have ovarian prblm also. Please give me a right suggestion.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "HelloYour findings need further investigations. You are rightly advised for CT scan or MVP. Findings suggests mild obstruction inn both kidneys and ultrasound may not be always able to detect underlying cause of obstruction. Obstruction may be due to many reasons like mild stricture etc. CT scan or MVP will be helpful in further management. You may only need follow-up ultrasound for Desmond cyst in ovary. It is a benign finding and small Desmond may regress with time. It is usually not a serious finding. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor. "}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the explanation for the physiological processes underlying amoebic meningoencephalitis?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Naegleria fowleri propagates in warm, stagnant bodies of freshwater (typically during the summer months), and enters the central nervous system after insufflation of infected water by attaching itself to the olfactory nerve.  It then migrates through the cribiform plate and into the olfactory bulbs of the forebrain,  where it multiplies itself greatly by feeding on nerve tissue. During this stage, occurring approximately 3\u20137 days post-infection, the typical symptoms are parosmia, rapidly progressing to anosmia (with resultant ageusia) as the nerve cells of the olfactory bulbs are consumed and replaced with necrotic lesions. After the organisms have multiplied and largely consumed the olfactory bulbs, the infection rapidly spreads through the mitral cell axons to the rest of the cerebrum, resulting in onset of symptoms.\nNaegleria fowleri has 3 stages in its life cycle: ameboid trophozoites, flagellates, and cysts. The only infective stage of the ameba is the ameboid trophozoite. Trophozoites are 10-35 \u00b5m long with a granular appearance and a single nucleus. The trophozoites replicate by binary division during which the nuclear membrane remains intact (a process called promitosis). Trophozoites infect humans or animals by penetrating the nasal tissue and migrating to the brain via the olfactory nerves causing primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Trophozoites can turn into a temporary, non-feeding, flagellated stage (10-16 \u00b5m in length) when stimulated by adverse environmental changes such as a reduced food source. They revert back to the trophozoite stage when favorable conditions return. Naegleria fowleri trophozoites are found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tissue, while flagellated forms are occasionally found in CSF. Cysts are not seen in brain tissue. If the environment is not conducive to continued feeding and growth (like cold temperatures, food becomes scarce) the ameba or flagellate will form a cyst. The cyst form is spherical and about 7-15 \u00b5m in diameter. It has a smooth, single-layered wall with a single nucleus. Cysts are environmentally resistant in order to increase the chances of survival until better environmental conditions occur.\nCopyleft images obtained courtesy of http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/pathogen.html"}

It looks that as the fillings of your back tooth were dislodged and the tooth was sensitive also it means that now the tooth has been infected, and you have to get re-restoration done.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is toxic megacolon?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Toxic megacolon was first discovered by Marshak and Lester in 1950. Jalen criteria was developed by Jalen et al to diagnose toxic megacolon in 1969. Toxic megacolon results from severe inflammation extending into the smooth-muscle layer and paralyses the colonic smooth muscle leading to dilatation. The extent of dilatation associated with the depth of inflammation and ulceratio n. Nitric oxide, an inhibitor of smooth-muscle tone, has an important role in the pathogenesis of toxic megacolon. Nitric oxide is produced by neutrophils and smooth-muscle cells in the inflamed colon. The most common cause of toxic megacolon include inflammatory bowel disease and Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis. The most common cause of toxic megacolon include inflammatory bowel disease and Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis. The precise incidence of toxic megacolon is unknown in general population. The incidence of toxic megacolon in the associated disorders including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is 1000-2500 in 100,000 cases and 4400-6300 in 100,000 cases, respectively. The mortality rate of toxic megacolon associated with Clostridium difficile is approximately 38%-80%. Common risk factors in the development of toxic negacolon include discontinuation of steroids, use of barium enemas, colonoscopy, chemotherapy, antidiarrheal drugs, anticholinergic drugs, narcotics, Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, organ transplantation, cardiothoracic procedures, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, renal failure. If left untreated, toxic megacolon in patients with ulcerative colitis lead to death in 0.2% patients. Common complications of toxic megacolon include perforation, bleeding, shock, sepsis. Prognosis is generally good. The diagnostic criteria for toxic megacolon is Jalan diagnostic criteria. Common symptoms of toxic megacolon include abdominal pain and cramping, diarrhea and fever. Less common symptoms include constipation and disorientation.Patients with toxic megacolon usually appear ill. Physical examination of patients with toxic megacolon is usually remarkable for abdominal pain, rebound tenderness and guarding, hypotension and tachycardia. Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of toxic megacolon include anemia and leukocytosis. Some patients with toxic megacolon may have elevated concentration of Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which is usually suggestive of inflammation. An x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of toxic megacolon. Findings on an x-ray diagnostic of toxic megacolon include dilated transverse colon (>6cm), thumbprinting, free intraperitoneal air and intraluminal soft-tissue masses. Ultrasound may be helpful in the diagnosis of toxic megacolon. Findings on an ultrasound suggestive of toxic megacolon include loss of haustra coli of the colon, hypoechoic and thickened bowel walls with irregular internal margins in the sigmoid and descending colon and significant dilation of the transverse colon. Abdominal CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of toxic megacolon. Findings on CT scan diagnostic of toxic megacolon include dilated transverse colon, loss of colonic haustrations, segmental parietal thinning, Intraluminal soft-tissue masses. Medical therapy of toxic megacolon include stablizing the patient, decompression and medications. Medications for toxic megacolon include corticosteroids, immunosuppresants and antibiotics. The mainstay of treatment for toxic megacolon is medical therapy. Surgery is usually reserved for patients with either failed medical therapy, progressive toxicity or dilation and signs of perforation. There are no established measures for the prevention of toxic megacolon."}

The morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.  So, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. Many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case.  If it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so I would repeat it in a week if that is the case. In addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. If you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks.  You should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"}

With resistance evolving so rapidly future treatments may include the use of vaccines to prevent these infections. Although a Cochrane systematic review of a polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine showed that it didn\u2019t reduce pneumonia or related deaths in adults, but it was able to reduce incidence of more specific outcomes such as pneumococcal disease in the elderly. So it is hoped with further developments these will become more effective against pneumonia.\nVaccination of patients with AECB in the autumn months is thought to have a positive effect in reducing the severity and number of exacerbations over winter. The oral vaccine described in this review was able to decrease the carriage or non- typeable Haemophilus influenzae that is a common cause of exacerbations to chronic bronchitis. With good planing and further research these types of vaccines may reduce the burden associated with lower respiratory diseases.\nThere are few treatments available for viral forms of bronchitis and pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the main cause of these in children, could be potentially treated using a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) Motavizumab. In animal trials it reduced antibody titres 100 times lower than the only drug currently available to treat the condition. This holds great promise for future treatments of LRTI."}

This issue was became very important to the extent that some decades ago, the leading cause of death among Hemophilia patients was AIDS and liver failure due to hepatitis. With improved screening of blood products, the risks of these infections is substantially reduced.  Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, although rare, is considered a medical emergency that can occur as a complication of hemophilia.

Regions with the highest incidences of HCPS include Patagonian Argentina, Chile, Brazil, the United States, Canada, and Panama, where a milder form of disease that spares the heart has been recognized. The two agents of HCPS in South America are Andes virus (also called Oran, Castelo de Sonhos, Lechiguanas, Juquitiba, Araraquara, and Bermejo viruses, among many other synonyms), which is the only hantavirus that has shown (only in a few clusters of cases) an interpersonal form of transmission, and Laguna Negra virus, an extremely close relative of the previously-known Rio Mamore virus. In the U.S., minor causes of HCPS include New York virus, Bayou virus, and possibly Black Creek Canal virus.\nAs of July of 2007, six states had reported 30 or more cases of Hantavirus since 1993 - New Mexico (69), Colorado (49), Arizona (46), California (43), Texas (33), and Washington (30). Other states reporting a significant number of cases include Montana (25), Idaho (19), and Utah (24). With only 7 cases, Oregon has a notably lower attack rate overall and relative to population, compared to other Western states."}

After hysterectomy there can be cancer cells in the area which might be spread in the tissues by micro invasion. This is the presence of cancer cells beyond the cut margins and cannot be seen with eyes. The high dose of radiation therapy tries to kill these cancer cells which are left over after surgery. Since there are some atypical cells after treatment, it is important to continue further treatment till all the abnormal cells have been treated. The last pap smear appears to be inconclusive. This means the results are not clear. You should not worry as regular treatment has been taken and most likely after 3 high dose radiation therapy sessions the cells are usually treated. In doing radiation the cell growth and multiplication is targeted and therefore there is a possibility that abnormal cells have been treated in your case, and you have been told not enough cells. Please do not worry."}

To find out whether you are pregnant or not: If the Chat Doctor levels are unable to detect your pregnancy, you may have to rely on the ultrasonography views.

Probably after few days, the picture may be more suggestive. 2. Take a decision about what is to be done with the Desmond cyst. The advice depends upon the site and size of the cyst. Your Obstetrician is the best adviser for this since he knows these details. Now-a-days, such cysts can be dealt Laparoscopically even during the pregnancy.

Elementary bodies (EBs) of C. psittaci are thought to infect their target cells in the lung by attachment to the base of cell surface microvilli, where they are actively engulfed by endocytosis or phagocytosis. Further studies on the C. psittaci -related species of C. caviae showed that initial attachment is mediated by electrostatic interactions, most likely with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moieties on the host cell surface. However, the observation that cellular binding of C. psittaci and related chlamydial strains is only partially or not inhibited by heparin strongly suggests that further adherence mechanisms contribute to chlamydial attachment. It was speculated that chlamydial cell contact is a two-step process:\nAlthough chlamydial entry is extremely efficient, the exact molecular details of bacterial uptake are not well understood. The host protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has been identified as being essential for both C. psittaci attachment and entry into cells. PDI is highly enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is also found on the cell surface where it catalyzes reduction, oxidation, and isomerization of disulfide bonds."}

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

Ultrastructurally, the eosinophilic cells have numerous mitochondria. In gross appearance, the tumors are tan or mahogany brown, relatively homogeneous, and usually well encapsulated. However, they may achieve a large size (up to 12 cm in diameter). Although anecdotal cases with metastases have been reported, the tumor is considered benign. There are some familial cases in which these tumors are multicentric rather than solitary."}

I am Chat Doctor. I will be answering your concerns today. Hi I wish you had given me some more information like your age, BMI etc. At first, I want to write to you certain facts. Among couples trying for pregnancy 80% of them conceive in the first year. 95% of them conceive by the end of second year. Therefore, the delay in your wife conceiving could be part of this natural process.  What tests have you done so far?  It is necessary that your wife gets hormone tests and tubal latency test done, and you get your semen analysis done. Based on these results, further treatment can be planned. To improve your chances of conception, you both need to maintain normal BMI, stop smoking if smoker and have intercourse at least 3-4 times in a week. I hope this is helpful. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. "}

They described the condition of icterus neonatorum as benign self-resolved disease. Between 1885 and 1891, some medical records from the original Providence hospital showed several cases of icterum neonatourm through the first week of life. In 1940, the Rh antigens were discovered and that confirmed the genetic basis of the neonatal jaundice disease. Between 1940 and 1950, some studies were performed on hemolytic diseases of the newborn in order to learn the pathogenesis of neonatal jaundice. These studies played a great role in development of a good perinatal and neonatal care.  In 1950, Dr. London published an article describing the mechanism of bile metabolism inside the human body.  In 1964, Dr. Arias was the first to describe the breast milk jaundice. \nGilbert syndrome:  In 1901, Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Lereboulet described the Gilbert syndrome as a cause of neonatal jaundice. It is now considered as the most common hereditary cause of hyperbilirubinemia in the neonates. Rotor syndrome: In 1948, Dr. Rotor described a defect of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin resulting in hyperbilirubinemia. Crigler-Najjar syndrome:  In 1952, Dr. Crigler and Dr. Najjar described the one type of syndrome due to absence of UGT1A1 enzyme activity. In 1962, Dr. Arias described another variation of the syndrome in which there is a reduced activity of UGT1A1 enzyme. The syndrome named either Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 or Arias syndrome. Dubin-Johnson syndrome:  In 1954, Dr. Dubin reported some cases of young adults with black liver and jaundice. Lucey-Driscoll syndrome:  In 1965, Dr. Lucey described another cause of severe. in the newborns during the first few days of life."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the definition of moxonidine and how does it work?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Moxonidine is a selective agonist at the imidazoline subtype 1 (I 1) receptor. This receptor subtype is found in both the rostral ventro-lateral pressor and ventromedial depressor areas of the medulla oblongata. Moxonidine therefore causes a decrease in sympathetic nervous system activity and, therefore, a decrease in blood pressure.\nCompared to the older central-acting antihypertensives, moxonidine binds with much greater affinity to the imidazoline I 1 -receptor than to the \u03b1 2 -receptor. In contrast, clonidine binds to both receptors with equal affinity.\nIn addition, moxonidine may also promote sodium excretion, improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance and protect against hypertensive target organ damage, such as kidney disease and cardiac hypertrophy."}

So this intercourse does not pause any threat of pregnancy. You may have some bleeding after few days and your menstruation may be delayed by few days to a week. However, you had one more unprotected intercourse on 12th Jan was not protected at all and hence this intercourse may result in pregnancy. You are not sure of the dates of menstruation. Moreover, you have taken Progesterone pills which will delay your menses. So you cannot figure out whether you have missed your period or not. Hence, the options to detect your pregnancy status are:1. Perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood after 29th Jan. 2. Perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample after 10th of Feb. I hope this resolves your dilemma. "}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nI was diagnosed with severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney in July. I had a stent put in on August 19th. My surgeon found a congenital stricture of the ureter. I am having an MRI in 2 weeks to role out a crossed vein/artery which could be constricting the uteter. I feel inclined to opt for pyeloplasty since the success rate is near 100%. My surgeon does open pyeloplasty. But having had laproscopic colorectal surgery last year, I would prefer to get robotics assisted laproscopic pyeloplasty. What are the major advantages and disadvantages of each type? Hypothetically, if it was you, your wife, or daughter who needed surgery, which would you choose/recommend and why? Also, I work full-time (40 hours/wk) as a graduate assistant in a university. I am also pursing my Master s degree concurrently. So, I can only do any surgery after the semester ends (after Dec. 8th and before Jan. 2nd). EeeWhich requires less healing time? Thank you for all of your help and advice.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "HelloThanks for query. You have been diagnosed to have congenital PUB obstruction which needs surgery of Pyeloplasty. As regards your query about the modality of surgery .if you were to be my close relative I would go for Laparoscopic Pyeloplasty which is done routinely all over the world. Technically Robotic pyeloplasty and Laparoscopic Pyeloplasty are similar except that one is performed by a laparoscopic surgeon himself while Robotic procedure is a Robot assisted laparoscopic surgery. Results of both the methods are similar However Robotic surgery is costlier than conventional laparoscopic surgery . Chat Doctor. "}

I am equally worried with the fact that i am also undergoing my infertility treatment cos of the low sperm count . pls advice\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. First, please re-check the content of Levosetride 5 mg yourself. It is Levocetrizine 5 mg. It is not a steroid. Furthermore, it is an antihistamine which is used in allergies and itching. Common side effects are sedation, Chat Doctor.  If you are not experiencing any of these, I would think you can continue using it for long period. I have not heard it to have any effect on infertility/infertility treatment.2. Personally I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you to identify the substances causing troubles to you and also to know how to avoid exposure to them.3. Please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.4. Regular breathing exercises and diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc.) will help you in a long run. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the patent for medical therapy of ductus arteriosus in preterm infants?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "In term infants the ductus closure occur by 24 hours of birth in 50% of babies, by 48 hours in 90% of babies and by 72 hours in most of them. However, the ductal closure is delayed in preterm infants.\nDuctal constriction occurs after birth due to the following reasons\nThe increased oxygen tension after birth with the onset of breathing. Decreased prostaglandin E2 due to removal of placenta. Increased removal of prostaglandin E2 from lung.\nProstaglandin E2 has been found to play a key role in maintaining the patency of ductus arterisus (DA) in the fetal life. Thus, the use of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (e.g, indomethacin and ibuprofen) have been found to be effective in the treatment of PDA. These drugs were also found to be useful in ductus closure if given antenatally. Patients with cases involving the transposition of the great vessels (TGV) may need the ductus arteriosus kept open with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Steroids like hydrocortisone have been found to decrease the sensitivity of ductus to PGE2. Thus, facilitating ductal constriction. Nitric oxide synthesized from endothelial cells have been shown to cause ductus constriction in animal studies."}

These things have created problems in your social life and poor rapport with child Chat Doctor.  The problem is there since childhood. Most likely the aggressive spells are occurring due to some behavioral problem and most likely due to intermittent explosive disorder. Other possibility is some personality disorder.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCould you please provide me the current wording of the sentence you want me to rephrase?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The pineal gland is a small reddish-brown structure that derives its name from its pinecone-like shape. The pineal ranges in size from 10 to 14 mm; it is located in the midline, above the tentorium and superior colliculi and below the splenium of the corpus callosum and the vein of Galen, and is attached to the superior aspect of the posterior border of the third ventricle. The blood supply of the pineal gland is derived from the posterior cerebral artery from its choroidal branches. The internal cerebral vein drains the blood from the epiphysis cerebri. Histologically the gland consists of cells called pinealocytes and supporting cells.\nPineal gland develops as a diverticulum in the diencephalic roof of the third ventricle during the second month of gestation. The mature gland is suspended from the pineal stalk from the posterior roof of the third ventricle. The pineal secretes melatonin, which is involved in diurnal rhythms.\nDue to the pineal gland's location, any tumor or cyst formation would lead to the compression of the aqueduct of Sylvius. The aqueduct of Sylvius allows the cerebrospinal fluid to circulate out. When there is a blockage in aqueduct of Sylvius by an abnormal pineal gland, the passage of the duct is blocked, and CSF pressure builds up, leading to hydrocephalus. Results in nausea, vomiting, visual changes, headaches, seizures, and memory changes. Increase in intracranial pressure can even be life-threatening, prompting emergency treatment. The hydrocephalus can be relieved by the placement of a VP shunt or ventriculostomy. Vision changes would also occur due to an involvement of the tectal region. The tectal region helps dictate eye movements. Fault in the tectal region causes double vision, an issue with focusing on objects, and eye movement impairment. The pineal gland can cause Parinaud syndrome due to the increasing size of the gland compressing the pretectal area and superior colliculi of the midbrain. Parinaud syndrome prevents a person from moving his or her eyes up and down. The thalamus can be affected, and if so, there can be disturbances on that side of the body which would result in weakness and loss of sensation. The tumor's effect on the hypothalamus will lead to weight gain, disruption of sleep, disruption of temperature control, and water regulation. Cerebellar involvement would result in motor impairment. If the tumor of the pineal gland is present in childhood, then endocrine dysfunctions can also result such as precocious pseudopuberty, diabetes insipidus, and a slowed growth rate."}

In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer. Mostly the bump is due to dilated blood vessel or hematoma. Both are benign conditions.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCould you explain what uterine prolapse means?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Treatment is not necessary unless the symptoms are bothersome. Most women seek treatment by the time the uterus drops to the opening of the vagina.\nUterine prolapse can be treated with a vaginal pessary or surgery.\nA vaginal pessary is a rubber or plastic donut-shaped device that is inserted into the vagina to hold the uterus in place. It may be a temporary or permanent form of treatment. Vaginal pessaries are fitted for each individual woman. Some pessaries are similar to a diaphragm device used for birth control. Many women can be taught how to insert, clean, and remove the pessary herself.\nPessaries may cause an irritating and abnormal smelling discharge, and they require periodic cleaning, sometimes done by the doctor or nurse. In some women, the pessary may rub on and irritate the vaginal wall (mucosa), and in some cases may damage the vagina. Some pessaries may interfere with normal sexual intercourse by limiting the depth of penetration.\nWeight loss is recommended in women with uterine prolapse who are obese.\nHeavy lifting or straining should be avoided, because they can worsen symptoms.\nCoughing can also make symptoms worse. Measures to treat and prevent chronic cough should be tried. If the cough is due to smoking, smoking cessation techniques are recommended.\nSurgery should not be done until the prolapse symptoms are worse than the risks of having surgery. The specific type of surgery depends on:\nDegree of prolapse Desire for future pregnancies Other medical conditions The women's desire to retain vaginal function The woman's age and general health\nThere are some surgical procedures that can be done without removing the uterus, such as a sacrospinous fixation. This procedure involves using nearby ligaments to support the uterus. Other procedures are available.\nOften, a vaginal hysterectomy is used to correct uterine prolapse. Any sagging of the vaginal walls, urethra, bladder, or rectum can be surgically corrected at the same time."}

Initial treatment often includes a combination of intravenous antibiotics including penicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin. If necrotizing fasciitis is suspected, surgical exploration is always necessary, often resulting in aggressive debridement (removal of infected tissue). As in other maladies characterized by massive wounds or tissue destruction, hyperbaric oxygen treatment can be a valuable adjunctive therapy, but is not widely available. Amputation of the affected organ(s) may be necessary. Repeat explorations usually need to be performed to remove additional necrotic tissue. Typically, this leaves a large open wound which often requires skin grafting. The associated systemic inflammatory response is usually profound, and most patients will require monitoring in an intensive care unit.\nNecrotizing fasciitis \n1.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is Pineocytoma, and how is it diagnosed?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "When evaluating a patient for pineocytoma, you should take a detailed history of the presenting symptom (onset, duration, and progression), other associated symptoms, and a thorough family and past medical history review.\nThe clinical presentation of pineocytoma is mainly from the obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to compression of the tectum of the midbrain and obstruction of the aqueduct.  Pineal tumors cause neurologic dysfunction by direct invasion, compression, or obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The rate of tumor growth determines the rapidity of symptom onset and is an important prognostic factor. Pineal gland tumors share some common clinical and radiographic features based upon their anatomic location. Symptoms of pineocytoma include:\nHydrocephalus is common, manifested by headaches, lethargy, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Progressive local tumor growth may result in cranial neuropathies or hypothalamic dysfunction. Sleepiness Irritability Personality changes Double vision Trouble coordinating motor movements Difficulty walking Slowed growth\nThe staging work-up for pineal tumors include\nContrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and the entire spine. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for cytological examination.\nCompression of the superior colliculi can lead to a characteristic gaze palsy, known as Parinaud syndrome. Common physical examination findings of pineocytoma include: \nBulging soft spots (fontanelles) Eyes that are constantly looking down (sunsetting sign) Deficiency in upward-gaze Pupillary light-near dissociation (pupils respond to near stimuli but not light) Convergence-retraction nystagmus\nMental retardation Muscle spasms Loss of bladder control Ataxia\nThere are no specific laboratory findings for pineocytoma. However, the following findings are of significant\nBoth serum and CSF should be assayed for alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) to help diagnose a germ cell tumor. Immunohistochemistry may be of value in detecting these markers or placental alkaline phosphatase.\nHead CT scan may be diagnostic of pineocytoma. Findings on CT scan suggestive of pineocytoma include a mass of intermediate density similar to the adjacent brain with peripheral calcifications. \nBrain MRI may be diagnostic of pineocytoma. Features on MRI suggestive of pineocytoma include: \nMRI component Findings T1 Isointense to brain parenchyma T2 Solid components are isointense to brain parenchyma Areas of cystic change Sometimes the majority of the tumor is cystic T1 with gadolinium contrast Solid components vividly enhance\nStereotactic biopsy\nA direct, visually guided biopsy of the pineal gland mass with open or neuroendoscopic surgery has been preferred due to concerns about injury to the deep cerebral veins. An open procedure also allows CSF to be obtained for Tumor marker studies Permits direct visualization of the third ventricle for staging purposes Sllows a third ventriculostomy to be performed for CSF diversion if needed. The diagnostic yield of stereotactic biopsy ranges from 94 to 100 percent. If the biopsy is nondiagnostic, equivocal, or suggests a benign tumor such as mature teratoma or meningioma, surgery is recommended to establish a definitive diagnosis or to identify focal areas of malignant disease"}

Since last week I ve been feeling spasms in my chest followed by a warm rush of blood sensation. I actually went to emergency because of this and was admitted to hospital for a few days with tachycardia. They reduced my heart rate with beta blockers but never addressed theses spasm sensations which are more disturbing to me than the fast pulse.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Betablockers are known to cause bronchospasm. Beta receptors in bronchi are needed for bronchodilator, Especially beta 2 receptors. So whenever nonselective beta blockers are given, they will block the action of beta 2 mediated bronchodilator and cause bronchospasm. So better to start cardio selective beta blocker (beta 1 selective). It Is having only beta 1 action and no action on beta 2 receptors in bronchi, So no bronchospasm. Beta 1 receptors are present in heart so beta 1 antagonist (cardio selective beta blocker) will have effect only on heart. So consult your cardiologist and change to cardio selective beta blocker."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the explanation for the physical structure and function of the human retina?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "In adult humans the entire retina is 72% of a sphere about 22 mm in diameter. An area of the retina is the optic disc, sometimes known as \"the blind spot\" because it lacks photoreceptors. It appears as an oval white area of 3 mm\u00b2. Temporal (in the direction of the temples) to this disc is the macula. At its center is the fovea, a pit that is most sensitive to light and is responsible for our sharp central vision. Human and non-human primates possess one fovea as opposed to certain bird species such as hawks who actually are bifoviate and dogs and cats who possess no fovea but a central band known as the visual streak. Around the fovea extends the central retina for about 6 mm and then the peripheral retina. The edge of the retina is defined by the ora serrata. The length from one ora to the other (or macula), the most sensitive area along the horizontal meridian is about 3.2 mm.\nIn section the retina is no more than 0.5 mm thick. It has three layers of nerve cells and two of synapses. The optic nerve carries the ganglion cell axons to the brain and the blood vessels that open into the retina. As a byproduct of evolution, the ganglion cells lie innermost in the retina while the photoreceptive cells lie outermost. Because of this arrangement, light must first pass through the thickness of the retina before reaching the rods and cones. However it does not pass through the epithelium or the choroid (both of which are opaque).\nThe white blood cells in the capillaries in front of the photoreceptors can be perceived as tiny bright moving dots when looking into blue light. This is known as the blue field entoptic phenomenon (or Scheerer's phenomenon).\nBetween the ganglion cell layer and the rods and cones there are two layers of neuropils where synaptic contacts are made. The neuropil layers are the outer plexiform layer and the inner plexiform layer. In the outer the rod and cones connect to the vertically running bipolar cells and the horizontally oriented horizontal cells connect to ganglion cells.\nThe central retina is cone-dominated and the peripheral retina is rod-dominated. In total there are about seven million cones and a hundred million rods. At the centre of the macula is the foveal pit where the cones are smallest and in a hexagonal mosaic, the most efficient and highest density. Below the pit the other retina layers are displaced, before building up along the foveal slope until the rim of the fovea or parafovea which is the thickest portion of the retina. The macula has a yellow pigmentation from screening pigments and is known as the macula lutea.\nThe vertebrate retina is inverted in the sense that the light sensing cells sit at the back side of the retina, so that light has to pass through a layer of neurons before it reaches the photoreceptors. By contrast, the cephalopod retina is everted: the photoreceptors are located at the front side of the retina, with processing neurons behind them. Because of this, cephalopods do not have a blind spot.\nThe cephalopod retina does not originate as an outgrowth of the brain, as the vertebrate one does. This shows that vertebrate and cephalopod eyes are not homologous but have evolved separately."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the diagnosis made by a pulmonary embolism CT?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Recent improvements in CT technology have reduced the value of CT angiography for the initial workup of PE patients. Studies surveying single detector spiral CT use in cases of suspected pulmonary embolism show wide variations in both sensitivity (53-100%) and specificity (73-100%) for detecting a PE.  \nTwo large multicentric clinical studies for single-detector CT, including more than 1000 patients, reported a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of a PE.   Due to motion artifacts and insufficient opacification, the rate of technical inadequacy of single detector CT in this study was 5-8%.\nTwo large studies have shown that a combination of a negative single detector CT and an absence of proximal lower limb DVT on lower limb venous ultrasonoagraphy in non-high clinical probability patients were associated with a 3-month thromboembolic risk of 1%.  \nSince its introduction, CT angiography has been the method of choice for visualizing the pulmonary vasculature for suspected PE patients. Although CT angiography remains the gold standard in diagnosing a PE, MDCT and SDCT are often the initial modes of evaluating patients with a suspected PE. In comparison to angiography, a CT is less invasive, takes less time, is easier to perform, and exposes the patient to lower amounts of radiation.\nHigh spatial resolution. High temporal resolution. Better quality of arterial opacification. Adequate visualization of pulmonary arteries up to at least the segmental level.\nA study enrolling 94 patients, done in 2004, showed the sensitivity and specificity of multi-detector CT to be above 90% in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. \nThe PIOPED II study, which enrolled 824 patients, published their results in 2006 showing a sensitivity and specificity of multi-detector CT to be 83% and 96% respectively in the diagnosis of PE.  The PIOPED II study also highlighted the influence of clinical probability on the predictive value of MDCT.\nAnother study with enrollment of 1819 patients, compared two diagnostic strategies based on D-dimer and MDCT, one with and the other without lower limb compression ultrasonography (CUS). The study reported that the 3-month thromboembolic risk was 0.3% (95% CI 0.1-1.1) in the D-dimer-Ultrasonography-CT (DD-US-CT) group and 0.3% (0.1-1.2) in the DD-CT group (difference 0.0% -0.9 to 0.8). In the DD-US-CT group, ultrasonography showed a deep-venous thrombosis in 53 (9% 7-12) of 574 patients, and thus MDCT was not undertaken. \nIn patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability of PE, a negative MDCT is adequate criteria for excluding PE. In patients with high a clinical probability of PE, and a negative CT, there is still some disagreement as to whether there should be further investigation by compression ultrasonography, ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan, or pulmonary angiography.  In patients with intermediate or high clinical probability of PE: A MDCT showing a PE at a segmental or more proximal level is adequate proof of PE in those patients. According to PIOPED II, the PPV of MDCT was found to be low (58%),  so further testing should be considered in the case of a negative MDCT.\nRight ventricular dysfunction is an independent predictor of clinical deterioration and death in pulmonary embolism patients, therefore it can be used for risk stratification for adverse outcomes. Thus MDCT has the potential to provide both diagnostic and prognostic stratification in acute pulmonary embolism patients.\nIn a study, a right-to-left ventricular dimensional ratio of less than 0.9 on MDCT was found to have a 100% NPV for death due to PE.  This could also be used to identify those patients at a low risk of death who are candidates for early discharge or home treatment.\nPresence of a single subsegmental clot on MDCT is termed as an isolated subsegmental PE. 1-5 % of patients with suspected PE undergoing MDCT have found to have an isolated subsegmental PE.   \nPositive predictable values of such findings are low. Compression ultrasonography is advised to rule out DVT, and it is used to assist in treating patients with isolated subsegmental PE. In patients with isolated subsegmental PE, but without DVT, no recommendation is made due to a lack of evidence."}

It does not predict future total cardiovascular events, i.e. it does not also predict risk for stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and heart failure. These also important patient outcomes were included in the 2008 Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score.  The predicted risk for an individual usually is higher with the 2008 Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score than with the 2002 Framingham Risk Score.\nThe Framingham Risk Score could overestimate (or underestimate) risk in populations other than the US population  , and within the USA in populations other than European Americans and African Americans, e.g. Hispanic Americans and Native Americans.  It is not yet clear if this limitation is real, or appears to be real because of differences in methodology, etc. As a result, other countries may prefer to use another risk score, e.g. SCORE, which has been recommended by the European Society of Cardiology in 2007. \nIf possible, a cardiology professional should select the risk prediction model which is most appropriate for an individual patient and should remember that this is only an estimate."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat functions do the kidneys serve?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by metabolism, including the nitrogenous wastes: urea (from protein catabolism) and uric acid (from nucleic acid metabolism) and water.\nThe kidney is one of the major organs involved in whole-body homeostasis. Among its homeostatic functions are acid-base balance, regulation of electrolyte concentrations, control of blood volume, and regulation of blood pressure. The kidneys accomplish these homeostatic functions independently and through coordination with other organs, particularly those of the endocrine system. The kidney communicates with these organs through hormones secreted into the bloodstream.\nThe kidneys regulate the pH, by eliminating H + ions concentration called augmentation mineral ion concentration, and water composition of the blood.\nBy exchanging hydronium ions and hydroxyl ions, the blood plasma is maintained by the kidney at a slightly alkaline pH of 7.4. Urine, on the other hand, is acidic at pH 5 or alkaline at pH 8.\nThe pH is maintained through four main protein transporters: NHE3 (a sodium-hydrogen exchanger), V-type H-ATPase (an isoform of the hydrogen ATPase), NBC1 (a sodium- bicarbonate cotransporter) and AE1 (an anion exchanger which exchanges chloride for bicarbonate). Due to the polar alignment of cells in the renal epithelia NHE3 and the H-ATPase are exposed to the lumen (which is essentially outside the body), on the apical side of the cells, and are responsible for excreting hydrogen ions (or protons). Conversely, NBC1 and AE1 are on the basolateral side of the cells, and allow bicarbonate ions to move back into the extracellular fluid and thus are returned to the blood plasma.\nSodium ions are controlled in a homeostatic process involving aldosterone which increases sodium ion reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules.\nWhen blood pressure becomes low, a proteolytic enzyme called Renin is secreted by cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (part of the distal convoluted tubule) which are sensitive to pressure. Renin acts on a blood protein, angiotensinogen, converting it to angiotensin I (10 amino acids). Angiotensin I is then converted by the Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lung capillaries to Angiotensin II (8 amino acids), which stimulates the secretion of Aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, which then affects the renal tubules.\nAldosterone stimulates an increase in the reabsorption of sodium ions from the kidney tubules which causes an increase in the volume of water that is reabsorbed from the tubule. This increase in water reabsorption increases the volume of blood which ultimately raises the blood pressure.\nAny significant rise or drop in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. A rise in osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone, resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.\nThe kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, urodilatin, renin and vitamin D."}

Tens of millions of individuals worldwide are estimated to become infected with Hep A each year.  The time between infection and the appearance of the symptoms (the incubation period) is between two and six weeks and the average incubation period is 28 days.  In developing countries, and in regions with poor hygiene standards, the incidence of infection with this virus is high  and the illness is usually contracted in early childhood. As incomes rise and access to clean water increases, the incidence of HAV decreases.  Hepatitis A infection causes no clinical signs and symptoms in over 90% of infected children and since the infection confers lifelong immunity, the disease is of no special significance to those infected early in life. In Europe, the United States and other industrialized countries, on the other hand, the infection is contracted primarily by susceptible young adults, most of whom are infected with the virus during trips to countries with a high incidence of the disease  or through contact with infectious persons."}

If I were in your situation(not as a medical graduate), I might have done the same. Being a graduate in modern medicine (allopathic), it is tough to comment on Homeopathy. But I can give you a clarification about why you should rely on modern medicine for the proper treatment of asthma. Modern medicine has improved to such level that one can have good asthma control if he /she follows physicians/specialist advice properly and follow up at regular interval. Even he/she may remain symptoms free without medicine. Asthelin inhaler relieves your acute attack whereas Forecourt(steroid preparation) 200 inhaler prevents as well as control further attack of asthma. Since you took forecourt via inhalation, only a very small amount of Chat Doctor. So the change of developing adverse effects like weight gain, gastric ulcer pain etc. are very unlikely. You might have other associated causes for weight gain like food habit, sedentary work etc. Moreover, steroid is sometimes used as pain reliever.

Infection causes inflammation and when it heals with the help of antibiotics or on its own it leaves behind scarring or in this case adhesions which may occur between the different organs present in the lower pelvic region.

Roaccutane is a wonderful medicine for acne, it would give good result in one month time, but it has certain side effects like, patient should not get pregnant during the course of medicine and at-least 3 months after stopping this medicine. It has teratogenic effect on the baby. Other precautions are that one should not donate blood during the course, should not wear contact lenses, should have a normal liver function test & blood counts before start of the medicine. And if you get headache after this medicine then you should stop the medicine. I hope this was told to you before start of the medicine. In your case pregnancy is the most important precaution. If you can take all the above precaution then roaccutane would be best to treat your acne, provided your hormone profile is normal. Once started this medicine needs to be given for at-least 6 months depending upon your body weight. Derive ms is just a gel and alone it might help you a little. Patient with hormone imbalance with associated acne would need hormonal medicine to treat their acne. So, kindly discuss all this with your dermatologist and then proceed for treatment.

Yeast infection is a common one to produce such inflammation, and we can confirm this with examination and simple investigations and treat with appropriate antifungal preparations. Scrotal pain may be due to Epididymitis. The cause of this also may have to be investigated with blood and urine tests. Sore back and Itchy feet seems not related to your sex relationship.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat medical treatment options are available for Hepatic encephalopathy?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Even minimal hepatic encephalopathy may benefit from treatment. \nReduce protein intake:\nTraditionally it has been presumed that excessive protein intake leads to increased generation of ammonia, which, in the setting of severe liver impairment, will accumulate and worsen the hepatic encephalopathy. While very large protein loads (such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, because blood is rich in protein) are known to precipitate encephalopathy, the need for patients with chronic liver disease patients to be protein restricted has been disproven.  Indeed, because chronic liver disease is a catabolic state, a protein restricted diet would lead to protein malnutrition and a negative nitrogen balance.\nCorrection of hypokalemia:\nConcomitant hypokalemia should be corrected as hypokalemia increases renal ammonia production and may promote conversion of ammonium into ammonia which can cross the blood-brain barrier. \nLactulose:\nLactulose is a compound that will cause osmotic diarrhea, thus lessening the time available for intestinal bacteria to metabolize protein into ammonia within the bowel. Further, it acidifies the environment in the lumen of the bowel. This promotes the conversion of lumenal ammonia (NH 3) to ammonium (NH 4 +) which, by which virtue of its net charge, should be less readily absorbed into the bloodstream from the bowel lumen. Despite this theoretical and appealing mechanism, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by the international Cochrane Collaboration found benefit, but suggests there is little evidence for its preferred use to treat hepatic encephalopathy.  Indeed, any drug (laxative) which speeds up transit through the bowel thereby lessening the time available for bacteria to metabolize protein into ammonia, works just as well.\nLactulose can be given rectally for patients who cannot take oral medications.    One regimen is 300 mL (200 gm) of lactulose syrup (10 gm/15 ml) in 1 L of water which is retained for 1 hour, with the patient in the Trendelenburg position. \nAntibiotics:\nAntibiotics may be given to kill bacteria present in the bowel thereby decreasing bacterial conversion of protein to ammonia (and other toxic substances) there. Although effective, neomycin, a non-absorbable aminoglycoside antibiotic, is essentially contraindicated; it has been found that a proportion of the ingested dose is indeed absorbed due to increased gut permeability, thus increasing the risk of renal failure and hearing loss (i.e. two of the potential side effects of neomycin). The former side-effect, in particular, is especially worrisome given the already increased likelihood of renal failure in cirrhosis and portal hypertension (i.e. hepatorenal syndrome). Metronidazole has also been studied. \nRifaximin:\nRifaximin, receieved orphan drug status in 2005 for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. In contrast to neomycin, its tolerability profile is comparable to placebo.  Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that rifaximin at a dose of 400 mg taken orally 3 times a day was as effective as lactulose or lactilol at improving hepatic encephalopathy symptoms.  Similarly, rifaximin was as effective as neomycin and paromomycin.  Rifaximin was better tolerated than both the cathartics and the other nonabsorbable antibiotics. A number of concerns remain regarding rifaximin's role in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. It remains to be determined if rifaximin can improve severe encephalopathy symptoms as rapidly as lactulose. There are also concerns regarding the cost-effectiveness of the medication.\nBenzodiazepine receptor antagonists:\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by the international cochrane collaboration found benefit from flumazenil.  The doses of flumazenil varied around a median of 2 milligrams over 10 minutes: flumazenil was given as a continuous infusion (12 trials), preceded by bolus injections in two trials. One trial used only bolus injections. Patients received flumazenil at a total dose ranging from 0.2 to 19.5 milligram (median 2 milligram). The median duration of treatment was 10 minutes (range one minute to 72 hours)'. However, the benefit was short.\nL- ornithine -L- aspartate:\nL- ornithine -L- aspartate stimulates the urea cycle, and has shown encouraging results in randomized controlled trials.   \nHepatic coma is considered an absolute contraindication to the use of the following medications:\nBumetanide Metolazone"}

Physical therapy can improve strength and flexibility in the trunk and legs, while nutritional changes and aerobic exercise can help patients lose weight, thereby decreasing the stress on the lumbar spine. Injections into the epidural space or into the spinal joints may help decrease inflammation and reduce back or leg pain, and alternative treatments such as acupuncture may also give relief. Bracing does not usually provide satisfactory relief. In some patients, symptoms may progress in spite of non-surgical care. This is often the case when a nerve root is chronically compressed.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat classification does congenital heart disease fall under?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Acyanotic heart defects comprise approximately 75% of all congenital heart defects. This contains any heart defect of a group of structural effects. It can be subdivided into two groups depending on whether there is shunting of the blood from the left vasculature to the right (left to right shunt) or no shunting at all.\nLeft to right shunting heart defects include ventricular septal defect or VSD (30% of all congenital heart defects), persistent ductus arteriosus or PDA, atrial septal defect or ASD, and atrioventricular septal defect or AVSD.\nAcyanotic heart defects without shunting include pulmonary stenosis, a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta.\nObstruction defects occur when heart valves, arteries, or veins are abnormally narrow or blocked. Common obstruction defects include pulmonary valve stenosis, aortic valve stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta, with other types such as bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and subaortic stenosis being comparatively rare. Any narrowing or blockage can cause heart enlargement or hypertension.\nA cyanotic heart defect is a group-type of congenital heart defects (CHD s). The patient appears blue (cyanotic), due to deoxygenated blood bypassing the lungs and entering the systemic circulation. This can be caused by right-to-left or bidirectional shunting, or malposition of the great arteries. Such defects include persistent truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great vessels, and tricuspid atresia.\nThe septum is a wall of tissue which separates the left heart from the right heart. It is comparatively common for defects to exist in the interatrial septum or the interventricular septum, allowing blood to flow from the left side of the heart to the right, reducing the heart's efficiency. Ventricular septal defects are collectively the most common type of CHD, although approximately 30% of adults have a type of atrial septal defect called patent foramen ovale. Septal defects may or may not cause cyanosis depending on the severity of the defect."}

I m afraid to take the drug because I could get low blood pressure and heart rate.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Pressure in the brain is called intracranial pressure. This pressure is different from blood pressure but complications due to high blood pressure can cause raised intracranial pressure. The intracranial pressure depends on the flow of cerebrospinal fluid which is surrounding the brain and spinal cord from every side. Increase in intracranial pressure can be due to brain swelling, bleeding within the brain, tumors inside the head and infections causing block of cerebrospinal fluid flow. Propranolol need not necessarily cause increased intracranial pressure. Please discuss with your neurologist."}

Jean-Baptiste de Senac (1693\u20131770) and Robert Adams (1827) were the first who mentioned atrium as the main origin of atrial fibrillation. For the first time in 1894 Theodor Wilhelm Engelmann introduced multi foci origins of irregular pulses in the atrial fibrillation. Disappearance of presystolic \u2018a\u2019 wave in the jugular phlebogram was first detected by Mackenzie (1853\u20131925). First time in 1906 an electrical tracing (ECG) of atrial fibrillation was published by Einthoven. William Withering was the first one who introduced the therapeutic properties of the digitalis leaf (digitalis purpurea) in 1785."}

Furthermore, I being a surgeon, we encounter so many such cases day in and day out. Furthermore, I read your question completely and have understood it well enough. Furthermore, I will analyze all your points below. 1. You had unprotected sex 2 times and you used spermicides too. Well, that itself tells you. There's no chance of pregnancy with the use of spermicidal agents. And even though you didn't use for 2nd time, it's effective. 2. Condom breakage is the most common problem encountered. But reading, your menstrual cycles I can say with certainty that you are safe.! 3. One day earlier completing periods again is the most important history. Generally, ovulation occurs 14 days after completion of periods. Especially in your 26 to 28 day cycle. So 100% there's no chance of ovulation and hence pregnancy even if he had ejaculated completely into your vagina! 4. No need for any kind of pill. Just chill and be happy. 5.

The most important indications of the molecular markers study include: \nIndeterminate cytological diagnosis To assist narrowing disease management options (medical treatment versus surgical treatment)\nThe molecular tests which have the most available data are Afirma Gene-expression Classifier, seven-gene panel of genetic mutations and rearrangements and galectin-3 immunohistochemistry.  \nA highly sensitive (92%) gene-expression classifier called Afirma evaluates the presence of related gene expression profiles. The low specificity of this technique (a negative predictive value of 93 %, positive predictive value and specificity of 48\u201353 %) lead to major usage of this technique as a rule out test to identify benign nodules. A benign gene expression classifier result predicts low risk of malignancy but there is still an up to 5% chance of malignancy in the nodules classified as benign.\nThe seven gene mutation and rearrangement analysis panel evaluates the following genetic mutations:\nPoint mutations BRAF gene NRAS gene HRAS gene KRAS gene Common rearrangements RET / PTC PAX8 /PPAR\u03b3\nThis technique has a high specificity (86\u2013100 %) and positive predictive value (84\u2013100 %) but poor a sensitivity (reported from 44 to 100 %), thus it is being used to rule in thyroid malignancies, mainly as the second line after gene expression classifier Afirma test.\nImmunohistochemistry evaluation of the marker galectin -3 should be performed on representative histological sections of the thyroid neoplasms that are obtained based on FNA or direct surgical biopsy. The samples should then be stained and then the staining can be graded. Specific cytoplasmic staining of more than 5% of the tumor cells, regardless of the intensity, is scored as positive for galectin -3. It has a high sensitivity especially for papillary thyroid carcinoma."}

However, orlistat is an FDA approved drug regimen for safe weight loss.\nWeight reduction can help to reduce levels of liver enzymes, insulin. Preferred regimen: Orlistat 120 mg PO q8h.\nThe direct effect of anti-lipid agents on NAFLD and liver histology has not been clearly understood; however, trials suggest no harm  and observational studies suggest benefit . Statins are the drugs of choice, however statins should not be administered as primary treatment of NAFLD, but rather as treatment of hyperlipidemia. The goal is to get the LDL down to < 100 mg/dl. Preferred regimen: Atorvastatin 40 mg PO q24h.\nRosiglitazone is recommended among all patients who develop NAFLD. Long term treatment with rosiglitazone in patients with NAFLD shows significant improvement. Preferred regimen: Rosiglitazone 4 mg PO/OD q24h.  Alternative regimen: Pioglitazone 4mg PO/OD.  Alternative regimen: Liraglutide 1.2 mg PO/OD.\nAntioxidants offer hepatocyte protection from free radical damage.\nPatients with NAFLD are recommended to use ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in combination with vitamin E.  Vitamin E alone or in combination with vitamin C is also recommended in patients without any side effects in fibrosis score.  Preferred regimen (1): Vitamin E 800 mg PO /OD.  Preferred regimen (1): Vitamin C 30 mg/Kg/PO/OD. Note: Avoid high dose of vitamin E which increases the fatality rate.\nThe combination of vitamin E (400 IU b.i.d.) and pioglitazone has been studies in one trial .\nMoringa Oleifera (MO), a plant from the family Moringacea is a major crop in Asia and Africa, the leaves of these plant have been studied extensively and it has shown to be beneficial in NAFLD and in prevention and alleviation of NAFLD."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat does drug resistance in HIV and AIDS refer to?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "As a retrovirus, HIV uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA from its RNA genome but it lacks a mechanism for correcting errors made while reproducing its genome.  As a result, HIV replicates its genome with the highest known mutation rate of any living organism.  This creates an ideal situation for natural selection to act on the HIV population, as genetic variation is the raw material for natural selection.  These mutations accumulate over generations in the HIV infected population, resulting in great genetic variation and an increased probability of a virion developing an evolutionary selective advantage over other virions.  Natural selection then acts on HIV by selecting for virions with higher fitness, as all others are eventually killed off by drug treatments.  The virions that are able to escape the harmful effects of the drug then create an entirely new, drug resistant population. With HAART, at least 3 drugs are administered at the same time, which substantially reduces viral load and, compared to results of earlier regimens, increases the life expectancy of patients. These advantages follow because the mutations necessary to confer resistance to HAART are generated at a slower rate and are lost more rapidly than those conferring resistance to monotherapy or dual therapy. Moreover, viral strains resistant to HAART are not as efficient at completing their own life cycle (e.g., their replication rates are lower), they may generate less illness and lower proportion of deaths among infected persons, and the viral strains are less likely to be transmitted to other persons."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat are angiograms and what are the techniques employed to conduct them?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Angiograms require the insertion of a catheter into a peripheral artery, e.g. the femoral artery.\nAs blood has the same radiodensity as the surrounding tissues, a radiocontrast agent (which absorbs X-rays) is added to the blood to make angiography visualization possible. The angiographic X-ray image shows shadows of the openings within the cardiovascular structures carrying blood (actually the radiocontrast agent within). The blood vessels or heart chambers themselves remain largely to totally invisible on the X-ray image.\nThe X-ray images may be taken as either still images, displayed on a fluoroscope or film, useful for mapping an area. Alternatively, they may be motion images, usually taken at 30 frames per second, which also show the speed of blood (actually the speed of radiocontrast within the blood) traveling within the blood vessel.\nThe most common angiogram performed is to visualize the blood in the coronary arteries. A long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is used so as to administer the radiocontrast agent at the desired area to be visualized. The catheter is threaded into an artery in the groin or forearm, and the tip is advanced through the arterial system into one of the two major coronary arteries. X-ray images of the transient radiocontrast distribution within the blood flowing within the coronary arteries allows visualization of the size of the artery openings. Presence or absence of atherosclerosis or atheroma within the walls of the arteries cannot be clearly determined. See coronary catheterization for more detail.\nAngiography is also commonly performed to identify vessel narrowing in patients with retinal vascular disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration."}

The celiac artery is the first major branch from the abdominal aorta, and is the only major artery that nourishes the digestive organs.       \nForegut Blood supply Esophagus Upper esophageal sphincter Cervical esophagus Inferior thyroid artery Thoracic esophagus Aortic esophageal arteries or branches of the bronchial arteries Distal esophagus Lower esophageal sphincter Left gastric artery and left phrenic artery Stomach Lesser curvature Right and left gastric arteries Greater curvature Right and left gastroepiploic arteries Gastric fundus Short gastric arteries Duodenum First and second parts Gastroduodenal artery (GDA) and Superior pancreaticoduodenal artery Third and fourth parts Inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery\nThe gastric mucosa is protected from the acidic environment by mucus, bicarbonate, prostaglandins, and blood flow.    This mucosal barrier consists of three protective components which include: Layer of epithelial cell lining. Layer of mucus, secreted by surface epithelial cells and foveolar cells. Layer of bicarbonate ions, secreted by the surface epithelial cells.\nThe following table demonstrates the defense mechanisms of gastric mucosal barrier \nThe main inciting event in the pathogeneis of upper GI bleeding is damage to mucosal injury. This mucosal injury can occur at various levels of GI tract. If the damage and bleeding is confined up to ligament of Treitz, it is defined as upper GI bleeding.  \nRegardless of etiology, if the balance of gastric acid secretion and mucosal defenses is disrupted, acid interacts with the epithelium to cause damage.    Varices are large, tortuous veins and protrude into the lumen, rupturing.  Helicobacter pylori disrupts the mucosal barrier and causes inflammation of the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum.   As the ulcer progresses beyond the mucosa to the submucosa the inflammation causes weakening and necrosis of arterial walls, leading to pseudoaneurysm formation followed by rupture and hemorrhage.  NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase, leading to impaired mucosal defenses by decreasing mucosal prostaglandin synthesis.  During stress, there is acid hypersecretion; therefore, the breakdown of mucosal defenses leads to injury of the mucosa and subsequent bleeding. Mucosal defects along with dilated and tortuous vessels in dieulafoy lesion put them at risk for rupture because of necrosis of the arterial wall from exposure to gastric acid.    \nGross Pathology Microscopic Pathology Varices Large and tortuous veins that protrude into the lumen Varices may be difficult to demonstrate in surgical specimens Mallory-Weiss Tear  Isolated or multiple cleft like mucosal defects Defects in the esophageal squamous mucosa.

Bed rest is recommended at least for the initial few months. AKT4 usually does not cause body pains unless there is some side effect like hepatitis and loss of appetite associated with this. By the way, I'm not really convinced based on the MRI report that he has tuberculosis of the spine, because degeneration is a very normal physiologic phenomenon at his age. I guess you need to take another opinion from a good doctor for the same. Thank you."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the medical treatment for Chikungunya?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Osteoarticular problems seen with Chikungunya fever usually subside in one to two weeks\u2019 time. In approximately 20% cases, they disappear after a few weeks. In less than 10% cases, they tend to persist for months. In about 10 % cases, the swelling disappears; the pain subsides, but only to reappear with every other febrile illness for many months. Each time the same joints get swollen, with mild effusion and symptoms persist for a week or two after subsidence of the fever. Destroyed metatarsal head has been observed in patients with persistent joint swelling. Since an immunologic etiology is suspected in chronic cases, a short course of steroids may be useful. Even though NSAIDs produce symptomatic relief in majority of individuals, care should be taken to avoid renal, gastrointestinal, cardiac and bone marrow toxicity. Cold compresses have been reported to lessen the joint symptoms.\nVarious neurologic sequelae can occur with persistent chikungunya fever. Approximately 40% of patients with chikungunya infection will complain of various neurological symptoms but hardly 10% will have persistent manifestations. Peripheral neuropathy with a predominant sensory component is the most common (5-8%). Paresthesias, pins and needles sensations, crawling of worms sensation and disturbing neuralgias have all been described by the patients in isolation or in combination. Worsening or precipitation of carpal tunnel syndrome has been reported in many patients. Motor neuropathy is rare. Occasional cases of ascending polyneuritis have been observed as a postinfective phenomenon, as seen with many viral illnesses. Seizures and loss of consciousness have been described occasionally, but a causal relationship is yet to be found. Anti-neuralgic drugs (amitryptyline, carbamazepine, gabapentin) may be used in standard doses in disturbing neuropathies. Ocular involvement during the acute phase in less than 0.5% cases as described above may lead to defective vision and painful eye in a small percentage. Progressive defects in vision due to uveitis or retinitis may require treatment with steroids.\nThe skin manifestations of Chikungunya fever subside after the acute phase is over and rarely require long term care. However worsening of psoriatic lesions and atopic lesions may require specific management by a qualified specialist. Hyperpigmentation and papular eruptions may be managed with Zinc oxide cream and/or Calamine lotion. Persistent non-healing ulcers are rare. Scrotal and aphthous- like ulcers on the skin and intertriginous areas may be managed by saline compresses, and topical or systemic antibiotics if secondarily infected.\nNeuro-psychiatric and emotional problems have been observed in up to 15% cases. These are more likely in persons with pre-morbid disorders and those with a family history of mood disorders. The emotional and psychosocial issues need individual assessment and have to be considered in the social context of the patient and community. Broadly, psychosocial support and reassurance may solve some of the problems. A well thought about plan for community support, occupational and social rehabilitation may hold the key for success."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the pathophysiological mechanism of Typhus?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The pathophysiology of typhus fever can be described in the following steps:      \nRickettsial pathogens are harbored by parasites such as fleas, lice, mites, and ticks. Organisms are transmitted by the bites from these parasites or by the inoculation of infectious fluids or feces from the parasites into the skin. Inhaling or inoculating conjunctiva with infectious material also causes infection.\nIncubation period of typhus fever varies from one to two weeks.\nFollowing transmission, rickettsia are ingested by macrophages and polymorphonuclea r cells. On ingestion, they replicate intracellularly inside the lysed cells and disseminate systemically.\nThe major pathology is caused by a vasculitis and its complications. On transmission, Rickettsia is actively phagocytosed by the endothelial cells of the small venous, arterial, and capillary vessels. It is followed by systemic hematogenous spread resulting in multiple localizing vasculitis. This process may cause result in occlusion of blood vessels and initiates inflammatory response (aggregation of leukocytes, macrophages, and platelets) resulting in small nodules. Occlusion of supplying blood vessels may cause gangrene of the distal portions of the extremities, nose, ear lobes, and genitalia. This vasculitic process causes destruction of the endothelial cells and leakage of the blood leading to volume depletion with subsequent hypovolemia and decreased tissue perfusion and, possibly, organ failure. Endothelial damage also leads to activation of clotting system (DIC).\nTumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) produce on activation of cell mediated immunity, stimulates T lymphocytes and macrophages, which help in eliminating intracellular rickettsia. Virulent rickettsia tend to suppress the activity of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IFN-gamma. Cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 12 promote production of Interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) responses. IFN-\u03b3, which drives TH1 -type responses and stimulates macrophage activation. Cytokines, which include, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-10, down-regulate the protective response."}

Maybe she has cold and a blocked nose, which prevents her from breathing while nursing. Make sure to hold the breast with your fingers to avoid blocking of the nasal passage. In case there is blocked nose due to cold, saline nasal spray on sos' basis will help. 2. The flow of the milk is more than what she can swallow, and therefore she stops sucking to swallow the milk before starting to suck again.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nHello, Dr. Rynne, I ve been a type 2 diabetic since February 1999 and I m being treated for hypertension. Both conditions are presently well-controlled. On September 9 of this year, blood test revealed eGFR of 57, creatine 1.36, calcium 10.8. My physician told me I was mildly anemic (I told her that I had eaten any meat for 9 months) and she said she d test again in 3 months (end of November). She also said she suspected I was dehydrated and she directed me to resume eating meat and to report for biweekly B-12 shots. Blood test results taken during work-related physical on October 3 indicated eGFR of 54, creatine 1.36 (again) and calcium 10.8 (again). Showed second set of results to my physician who told me not to be too concerned and to await follow-up blood test scheduled for end of November. She doesn t believe I have CKD at this point and feels that the totality of my bloodwork doesn t justify this diagnosis. She stated that eGFR values can move up and down given many factors at time of testing. I have read that once eGFR diminishes, it cannot recover...Doctor, is it possible that I don t yet have kidney disease? And is it possible for eGFR to improve?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi, I appreciate your concerns. The risk factors for CKD in your case are diabetes and blood pressure of long duration. If the GFR remains below 60 for a duration of 3 months we label it as CKD stage 2. If you have significant amount of protein in the urine most likely you have kidney dysfunction secondary to diabetes. But there is nothing to worry as we have diagnosed it early and if taken precautions the EFR can be maintained for a long time. The key to prevent further progression at this point is a good control of blood sugar and blood pressure, weight reduction and regular follow up. The anemia is most likely secondary to nutritional deficiency as you are already taking vitamin supplements. I will e pleased to take any queries from you. Tx"}

An electrocardiogram (Figure 1) revealed an inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction and the patient was referred for emergent cardiac catheterization. An initial attempt to engage the left coronary artery was unsuccessful. Nonselective injection of the left coronary sinus failed to identify a coronary ostia (Figure 2). Selective angiography of the right coronary artery (RCA) revealed a single coronary trunk that gave rise to separate origins of the major coronary arteries. The left circumflex artery (LCx) reached the left atrioventricular groove by coursing anterior to the pulmonary artery. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) courses posterior to the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and then intraseptally to emerge in the anterior interventricular groove. An acute RV marginal branch also wraps anterior to the pulmonary artery and then courses toward the cardiac apex parallel to the LAD just to the right of the interventricular groove. The right coronary artery was occluded beyond the origin of these vessels (Figures 3,4) and was successfully stented (Figure 5,6). Multislice coronary computed tomography angiography confirmed the anatomical variant and the course of the vessels (Figures 7,8)."}

A significant proportion of the patients can be asymptomatic and the diagnosis is usually made in the setting of an unrelated condition. The most overlapping and common findings encountered are anemia and splenomegaly presenting as weakness, easy fatigability, palpitations, and dyspnea in the case of anemia and early satiety with possible accompanying left upper quadrant discomfort if splenomegaly is present. The disease has a progressive course and can result in pancytopenia as the bone marrow failure ensues. This can result in bleeding complications, easy bruising, increase in the susceptibility to infections, and worsening anemia. The bone marrow failure paves the way for extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) which mainly occurs in the reticuloendothelial tissues. If left untreated, myelofibrosis can lead to severe complications, the most feared of which are acute leukemia, heart failure, and portal hypertension."}

It can either be a gingival abscess Chat Doctor.  Lesion on the gums is also caused due to periapical abscess arising from the infected tooth or periodontal abscess. This can be confirmed by taking an x-ray of the affected area and accordingly treatment can be planned. Gingival abscess can be treated by deep curettage and scaling of the gum pocket by a dentist, so you need to approach a dentist soon. If the lesion is associated with tooth, the underlying infection need to be treated followed by a course of antibiotic and analgesics. I hope this helps, take care."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat are the natural progression, predicted outcomes and possible complications associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hemorrhage: Acute promyelocytic leukemia is frequently associated with bleeding caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Hemorrhagic and bleeding diathesis are the major causes of early complications that can lead to immediate death in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. For this reason, prompt treatment of the disease is required.   Venous thromboembolism: Thrombus formation is a major cause of morbidity in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Thrombosis in the setting of acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated with a worse outcome compared to non-cancer-related thrombosis. Studies have shown that rate of venous thromboembolism was 10.8 % in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The reason for this correlation between thrombosis and death in acute promyelocytic leukemia is that thrombosis is a surrogate marker for disease progression.     Procoagulants: There is increased production of procoagulant molecules such as thrombin from cancer cells. Furthermore, mucins and cytokines produced by malignant promyelocytes can induce endothelial cells to increase tissue factor production, and tissue factor functions in the extrinsic pathway to promote coagulation.  Platelets: There is a increased platelet activation in acute promyelocytic leukemia.  Fibrin: There is decreased fibrinolytic activity in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and this results in presence of excess fibrin. Fibrin is also known as factor I of the coagulation cascade and functions to binds platelets together via their GpIIb/IIIa receptors. This is one of the final steps in coagulation.   Natural anticoagulants: There is decreased production of natural anticoagulants, and this results in increased propensity for thrombosis.  Catheters: Central venous catheters can serve as a nidus for thrombosis since there is localized tissue and endothelial damage at the site of catheter insertion and along the catheter within the body. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia are more likely to have central venous catheters, compared to patients with other conditions, since chemotherapy usually requires the presence of a central catheter to be placed.    Immobility: Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia are frequently confined to a hospital bed during induction therapy, and venous stasis contributes to thrombosis. Obesity can also contribute to thrombosis.  Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia frequently have anemia. Some patients receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, such as erythropoietin, which can increase red blood cell production and exacerbate thrombotic complications.   \nIn a 2015 study from MD Anderson Cancer Center, it was shown that the annual incidence of venous thromboembolism, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, was 6.1-42%, which is the highest amongst all leukemia sub-types. In contrast, the incidence of venous thromboembolism in chronic myeloid leukemia was only 1.5%. \nDisease Thrombotic Incidence Acute promyelocytic leukemia 6.1-48% Acute myeloid leukemia 3.7% Chronic lymphocytic leukemia 2.7% Acute lymphoblastic leukemia 2.1-13% Chronic myeloid leukemia 1.5%\nTherapy-related complications: Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia can result in a variety of complications, which are somewhat unique to the disease. Differentiation syndrome:       Differentiation syndrome is a clinical condition that results from treatment with all- trans retinoic acid. Differentiation syndrome This condition is characterized by weight gain, peripheral edema, hypoxia, dyspnea, renal failure, fever, and hypotension. The syndrome is thought to be due to systemic inflammation induced by the release of cytokines from malignant promyelocytes. This results in endothelial cell damage with resultant capillary leakage. Malignant promyelocytes are then able to adhere to tissue that is perfused by the micro-circulation. Patients with a high white blood cell count are at highest risk for differentiation syndrome, since all- trans retinoic acid will result in release of a large amount of cytokines if there is a high leukemia burden. Differentiation syndrome is a major complication that must be recognized early on, such that proper corrective measures can be taken. These include the use of dexamethasone 10 mg PO twice daily, plus supportive treatment for any underlying respiratory distress. Diuresis may be needed to help eliminate excess fluid accumulation. QT interval prolongation:    Arsenic trioxide can result in prolonged QT interval, which carries a risk for cardiac-related complications such as arrhythmias. Patients who are treated with arsenic trioxide must have routine electrocardiograms (EKGs) done to ensure that the corrected QT interval remains less than 500 milliseconds. In patients who are treated with concomitant chemotherapy and arsenic trioxide, such as patients with high-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, there is a higher risk for cardiac-related complications. Chemotherapy and intravenous fluids can alter electrolyte such as potassium levels. Hypokalemia (low potassium) can exacerbate QT prolongation. Cardiomyopathy:   Patients receiving chemotherapy with anthracyclines, such as idarubicin or daunorubicin, are at risk for short-term cardiac-related complications such as arrhythmias and long-term cardiac-related complications such as systolic dysfunction and heart failure. The highest risk of these complications occurs in patients with underlying cardiomyopathy such as congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or other cardiac issues. The cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is dose-dependent and generally irreversible."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL or DLBL) is a cancer of B cells, a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma may be classified based on location into nodal and extranodal disease and based on molecular, genetic, and immunohistochemical features into more than 20 subgroups. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma may be classified into 2 subtypes based on gene expression profiles. The progression to diffuse large B cell lymphoma involves the microRNAs (miRNAs). On microscopic histopathological analysis, diffuse large B cell lymphoma can be divided into three variants: centroblastic, immunoblastic, and anaplastic. There are no established causes for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among adults, with an annual incidence of 7\u20138 cases per 100,000 people per year. This cancer occurs primarily in older individuals, with a median age of diagnosis at approximately 70 years of age, though it can also occur in children and young adults in rare cases. The most potent risk factor in the development of diffuse large B cell lymphoma is immunodeficiency. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma must be differentiated from other diseases such as follicular lymphoma, Mucosa-Associated Lymphatic Tissue lymphoma (MALT), small cell lymphocytic lymphoma, and Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma depends on the stage of the disease. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is associated with a 5 year survival rate ranging from 70% to more than 90% among children. According to the Lugano classification, there are four stages of diffuse large B cell lymphoma based on the number of nodes involved and extranodal status. The most common symptoms of diffuse large B cell lymphoma include a rapidly enlarging, non-painful mass that may be located in neck, groin or abdomen. The less common symptoms of diffuse large B cell lymphoma include fever, weight loss and drenching night sweats. Common physical examination findings of diffuse large B cell lymphoma include a non tender mass which can arise in virtually any part of the body. Laboratory tests of diffuse large B cell lymphoma include complete blood count, blood chemistry studies, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, cytology, genetic testing, and immunophenotyping. CT scan, MRI, and PET may be helpful in the diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Lymph node or extranodal tissue biopsy is diagnostic of large B cell lymphoma. Other diagnostic studies for diffuse large B cell lymphoma include laparoscopy, laparotomy, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The optimal therapy for diffuse large B cell lymphoma depends on the stage at diagnosis. The predominant therapy for diffuse large B cell lymphoma is chemotherapy. Adjunctive radiotherapy may be required. Active areas of research include genetic studies to assess the genetic role in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and novel therapeutic regimens that evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel regimens in in newly diagnosed diffuse large B cell lymphoma."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the connection between the jaw and vertebrates?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "In most vertebrates, the jaws are bony or cartilaginous and oppose vertically, comprising an upper jaw and a lower jaw.\nIn vertebrates, the lower jaw, dentary or mandible is the mobile component that articulates at its posterior processes, or rami (singular ramus), with the temporal bones of the skull on either side; the word jaw used in the singular typically refers to the lower jaw.\nThe upper jaw or maxilla is more or less fixed with the skull and is composed of two bones, the maxillae, fused intimately at the median line by a suture; incomplete closure of this suture and surrounding structures may be involved in the malformation known as cleft palate.\nThe maxillary bones form parts of the roof of the mouth, the floor and sides of the nasal cavity, and the floor of the orbit or eye socket.\nThe jaws typically accommodate the teeth or form the bases for the attachment of a beak.\nThe vertebrate jaw probably originally evolved in the Silurian period and appeared in the Placoderm fish which further diversified in the Devonian. Jaws are thought to derive from the pharyngeal arches that support the gills in fish. The two most anterior of these arches are thought to have become the jaw itself and the hyoid arch, which braces the jaw against the braincase and increases mechanical efficiency. While there is no fossil evidence directly to support this theory, it makes sense in light of the numbers of pharyngeal arches that are visible in extant jawed (the Gnathostomes), which have seven arches, and primitive jawless vertebrates (the Agnatha), which have nine.\nIt is thought that the original selective advantage garnered by the jaw was not related to feeding, but to increased respiration efficiency. The jaws were used in the buccal pump (observable in modern fish and amphibians) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs in the case of amphibians. Over evolutionary time the more familiar use of jaws (to humans), in feeding, was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates.\nIn reptiles, the mandible is made up of five bones. In the evolution of mammals, four of these bones were reduced in size and incorporated into the ear. In their reduced form, they are known as the malleus and incus; along with the more ancient stapes, they are the ossicles. This adaptation is advantageous, not only because a one-bone jaw is stronger, but also because the malleus and incus improve hearing. (However, reptiles tend to swallow prey whole because their pace of digestion is different than mammals, so multiple jaw bones may allow flexibility to expand the jaws around prey.)"}

Lower respiratory specimen testing appears to be more sensitive in the detection of MERS-CoV, when compared to specimens from the upper respiratory tract.      It is recommended the collection of multiple specimens from different locations and in different times, in order to increase the probability of collecting and detecting the pathogen, by virtue of the potential impact of the infection by MERS-CoV, the risk of transmission and how little is known about the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests for this virus.   It is recommended that, in all cases of severe disease, priority is given to respiratory samples, particularly lower respiratory tract specimens In the case of mild disease, upper tract specimen should be collected In the case of lower tract specimens cannot be obtained. Serum samples should be collected for serologic testing, as well as a stool sample or a rectal swab. However, contrariwise to SARS-CoV, stool samples have a very low concentration of MERS-CoV.  In the presence of a negative test result in an highly suspicious patient, for infection by MERS-CoV, further samples should be collected for testing. A false-negative result is commonly due to any of the following:  Poor specimen quality Wrong timing of collection Mishandled/shipped sample Technical problem during testing\nCollect 2-3 mL into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap sputum collection cup or sterile dry container. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8\u00b0C up to 72 hours; if exceeding 72 hours, freeze at -70\u00b0C and ship on dry ice. \nHave the patient rinse the mouth with water and then expectorate deep cough sputum directly into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap sputum collection cup or sterile dry container. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8\u00b0C up to 72 hours; if exceeding 72 hours, freeze at -70\u00b0C and ship on dry ice. \nUse only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts. Do not use calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts, as they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing. Place swabs immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 ml of viral transport media. NP/OP specimens can be combined, placing both swabs in the same vial. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8\u00b0C up to 72 hours; if exceeding 72 hours, freeze at -70\u00b0C and ship on dry ice. \nInsert a swab into the nostril parallel to the palate. Leave the swab in place for a few seconds to absorb secretions. Swab both nasopharyngeal areas. \nSwab the posterior pharynx, avoiding the tongue. \nCollect 2-3 mL into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap sputum collection cup or sterile dry container. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8\u00b0C up to 72 hours; if exceeding 72 hours, freeze at -70\u00b0C and ship on dry ice. \nFor serum antibody testing: serum specimens should be collected during the acute stage of the disease, preferably during the first week after onset of illness, and again during convalescence, \u22653 weeks after the acute sample was collected. However, since we do not want to delay detection at this time, a single serum sample collected 14 or more days after symptom onset may be beneficial. Serologic testing is currently available at CDC upon request and approval. Please be aware that the MERS-CoV serologic test is for research /surveillance purposes and not for diagnostic purposes - it is a tool developed in response to the MERS-CoV outbreak. Contact CDC \u2019s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) (770-488-7100) for consultation and approval if serologic testing is being considered. \nCollect 1 tube (10 mL) of heparinized (green-top) or EDTA (purple-top) blood.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat would be the EKG reading of a person who has a pacemaker?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "AOO (Atrial asynchronous): Also called a fixed-rate atrial pacemaker. No sensing function. A lead is connected to the RA, which it paces at a preset rate, regardless of the patient's own heart rate or rhythm. Requires an intact AV conduction system. Rarely used. AAI, and AAT (Atrial demand pacemakers): In AAI pacemakers, if there is spontaneous atrial activity at a rate greater than (or the PP interval is less than) a predetermined level, then no stimulus is delivered. In AAT pacemakers, the pacer senses the atrial impulse and stimulates the atrium when the atrial rate falls below a certain level, but it also delivers stimuli when it senses native P waves. Also rarely used. VOO (Ventricular asynchronous): Also called fixed-rate ventricular pacemakers. Delivers stimuli at a constant rate regardless of the patient's own heart rate or rhythm. Competes with the patient's native QRS, if the latter are present. Each stimulus is followed by a QRS complex unless the stimulus occurs during the ventricular refractory period. Fusion beats may be seen, part of the ventricle depolarized by the patient's own impulse and part by the artificial pacemaker. There is a risk that the spike may fall during the vulnerable period, resulting in ventricular fibrillation. Risk is low in most patients but increases in the presence of ischemia, electrolyte imbalance, or drug toxicity. A magnet converts demand pacemakers to this mode of pacing. VVI or VVT (Ventricular Demand Pacemakers): Most popular in use, particularly VVI. The pacemaker generates impulses whenever the patient's own ventricular rate falls below a predetermined level. The stimulus is suppressed of the patient's own ventricular rate is above this level. Pacing rate is usually 72 beats/minute. The interval from a native complex to that of a pacemaker spike is called the escape interval. This interval may not be the same as the pace interval (the spike-to-spike interval) and is usually much longer because depending on the site of origin of the spontaneous impulse, its potential may not be sensed by the pacemaker until the later portion of the depolarization. In some pacemakers, the escape interval is deliberately set longer than the pacing interval a feature which is known as hysteresis. Fusion beats may occur. Occasionally there are pseudofusion beats in which case the pacemaker spike falls on the spontaneous beat. The pacemaker spike does not cause depolarization, and other than the superimposed spike, it has the same morphology as a pure spontaneous beat. occurs when the pacemaker fires during the absolute refractory period of the heart. Pseudofusion beats are more likely to be seen in those patients with an IVCD or PVCs. May be seen in patients with a RV pacemaker and left-sided PVCs or an LV pacemaker and a right-sided PVC. VVI pacemaker in the magnet mode: Converts the pacemaker to a fixed-rate mode. A significant decrease in the pacing rate indicates a decrease in the pacemaker's battery voltage. Rate-responsive pacemakers: Increase the pacing rate in response to physiologic demands. Methods of detecting the need for an increased rate include a piezoelectric crystal that detects vibration generated by body motion, an RV body temperature monitor, the measurement of the QT interval, mixed venous O2 saturation. VVT (Ventricular triggered pacemakers): Functions similarly to the inhibited type (VVI) of pacemaker in that it delivers a stimulus at a preset interval if no spontaneous ventricular depolarization is detected. It differs from the ventricular inhibited pacemakers by also delivering a stimulus immediately after a spontaneous QRS is sensed. When there is a spontaneous ventricular complex, the pacing spike comes shortly after the QRS. In the paced beats, the stimulus spike initiates rather than falls on the QRS complexes. Were originally developed to avoid the potential problem of pacemaker inhibition by extracardiac signals such as those that originated from skeletal muscles or radio transmitters. Modern circuitry has reduced the likelihood of such interferences. Because of power drain distortion of the native QRS This mode is infrequently used."}

This is on the basis of size and hemoglobinization of the red blood cells. A variation in size and shape of red blood cells is described as anisopoikilocytosis. This variation is seen in anemia. Anemia causes fall in hemoglobin levels. The fall in hemoglobin can be due to many reasons. Dietary deficiency is the commonest cause of anemia. Deficiency of iron and vitamin B 12-folic acid can cause this deficiency. Presence of oval shaped cells is called phagocytes which have been mentioned in your report. You need to consult your doctor to find out whether the phagocytosis is due to vitamin B 12-folic acid deficiency. In case vitamin B 12-folic acid deficiency is present, supplements need to be taken.

Try to be less sensitive, confident, don't think what people may say and be expressive. When you make a mistake, don't get angry or embarrassed rather laugh at it when others laugh so that slowly you get comfortable and your friends start enjoying your funny company. If you think you lack topic to discuss or talk, buy joke books (read it) and start cracking jokes from time to time. Everyone loves a happy person. Social anxiety is a fully treatable and can be overcome with effective therapy, work, and patience. Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse in the childhood sometimes make people anxious, come out of your hurt, fears and bad memories. You can contact a counselor or a psychotherapist, cognitive behavioral therapy is effective.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat are the classifications of respiratory diseases?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) are characterised by an increase in airway resistance, shown by a decrease in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR; measured in spirometry) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1). The Residual Volume, the volume of air left in the lungs following full expiration, is greatly increased in COPD, while the total lung volume (TLC)is normal, leading to the clinical sign of chest over-inflation in patients with severe disease. Many individuals with COPD present with \"barrel chest\" - a deformity of outward rib displacement due to chronic over-inflation of the lungs,also, in severe COPD, a flattening of the diaphragm can be seen on chest radiograph.\nExamples of obstructive lung diseases include:\nEmphysema Acute & Chronic Bronchitis Asthma Bronchiectasis Bronchiolitis\nRestrictive Lung Diseases (RLD) are characterized by a loss of airway compliance , causing incomplete lung expansion (i.e. via increased lung'stiffness'). This change manifests itself in a reduced Total Lung Capacity, Inspiratory Capacity and Vital Capacity.\nIn contrast to OPD, RLD values for Tidal Volume, Expiratory Reserve Volume, Functional Residual Capacity and Respiratory Volume are unchanged. The FEV1 for a patient with RLD will either be normal or slightly increased, and thus the FEV1/FVC ratio will also be normal or increased for a RLD patient.\nNotable restrictive lung diseases include:\nFibrosis Sarcoidosis Pleural effusion Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Asbestosis Pleurisy Lung Cancer Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Neurologic diseases affecting the ability of the body to alter respiration rate, including spinal cord injury Mechanical diseases affecting pulmonary musculature, including myasthenia gravis Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nThe basic functional units of the lung, the alveoli, are referred to as the lung parenchyma. Diseases such as COPD are characterised by destruction of the alveoli and are therefore referred to as parenchymal lung diseases.\nSigns of parenchymal lung disease include, but are not limited to, hypoxemia (low oxygen in the blood), hypercapnoea (high carbon dioxide in the blood), and abnormal DLCO tests.\nChronic complications of parenchymal lung disease include reduced respiratory drive, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right heart failure (cor pulmonale).\nAs can be seen from the overlap in categories, parenchymal diseases can be either restrictive, obstructive or both.\nNotable parenchymal diseases include:\nCOPD Sarcoidosis Pulmonary fibrosis Emphysema\nVascular lung disease refers to conditions which affect the pulmonary capillary vasculature. Alterations in the vasculature manifest in a general inability to exchange blood gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, in the vicinity of the vascular damage (other areas of the lung may be unaffected).\nSigns of vascular lung disease include, but are not limited to, hypoxemia (low oxygen in the blood) and hypercapnoea (high carbon dioxide in the blood).\nChronic complications of vascular lung disease include reduced respiratory drive, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right heart failure (cor pulmonale).\nNotable vascular lung diseases include:\nPulmonary oedema Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary hypertension\nInfectious Respiratory Diseases are, as the name suggests, typically caused by one of many infectious agents able to infect the mammalian respiratory system (for example the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae).\nThe clinical features and treatment options vary greatly between infectious lung disease sub-types as each type may be caused by a different infectious agent, with different pathogenesis and virulence. Features also vary between:\nUpper respiratory tract infection, including strep throat and the common cold; and Lower respiratory tract infection, including pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis\n\"Respiratory tumor\" can refer to either neoplastic (cancerous) or non-neoplastic masses within the lungs or lung parenchyma.\nNeoplastic respiratory tumors: Respiratory neoplasms are abnormal masses of tissue within the lungs or parenchyma whose cell of origin may or may not be lung tissue (many other neoplasms commonly metastasize to lung tissue). Respiratory neoplasms are most often malignant, although there are non-malignant neoplasms which can affect lung tissue.\nNon-neoplastic respiratory tumors: Tuberculosis cysts, other non-neoplastic masses.\nFollowing is another classification of respiratory tumors:\nMalignant tumors, or cancers of the respiratory system, particularly lung cancers, are a major health problem responsible for 15% of all cancer diagnoses and 29% of all cancer deaths . The majority of respiratory system cancers are attributable to smoking tobacco.\nThe major types of respiratory system cancer are:\nSmall cell lung cancer Non-small cell lung cancer Adenocarcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma Large cell undifferentiated carcinoma Other lung cancers (carcinoid, Kaposi sarcoma, melanoma) Lymphoma Head and neck cancer Mesothelioma, usually caused by exposure to asbestos dust.\nIn addition, since many cancers spread via the bloodstream and the entire cardiac output passes through the lungs, it common for cancer metastases to occur the lung. Breast cancer may invade directly through local spread, and through lymph node metastases. After metastasis to the liver, colon cancer frequently metastasizes to the lung. Prostate cancer, germ cell cancer and renal cell carcinoma may also metastasize to the lung.\nTreatment of respiratory system cancer depends on the type of cancer. Surgery (usually removal of part of the lung, a lobectomy or an entire lung, a pneumonectomy), chemotherapy and radiotherapy are all used. The chance of surviving lung cancer depends on the cancer stage at the time the cancer is diagnosed and is only about 14-17% overall . In the case of metastases to the lung, treatment can occasionally be curative but only in certain, rare circumstances.\nBenign tumours are relatively rare causes of respiratory disease. Examples of benign tumours are:\nPulmonary hamartoma Congenital malformations such as pulmonary sequestration and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM).\nThe brain co-ordinates breathing and sends messages via nerves to the muscles of respiration. The muscles produce the movements of breathing. Disorders of the brain\u2019s control of breathing, the nerves or the muscles of respiration can affect the respiratory system. Common disorders of breathing mechanics are:\nObstructive sleep apnea Central sleep apnea Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Guillian-Barre syndrome Myasthenia gravis\nObesity is often associated with sleep apnea and can cause either an obstructive or a restrictive pattern on spirometry. Obesity reduces the movement of the chest wall which can, in extreme cases, result in the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, a cause of respiratory failure.\nPulmonary vascular diseases are conditions that affect the pulmonary circulation. Examples of these conditions are:\nPulmonary embolism, a blood clot that forms in a vein, breaks free, travels through the heart and lodges in the lungs (thromboembolism). Large pulmonary emboli are fatal, causing sudden death. A number of other substances can also embolise to the lungs but they are much more rare: fat embolism (particularly after bony injury), amniotic fluid embolism (with complications of labour and delivery), air embolism (iatrogenic). Pulmonary arterial hypertension, elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries. It can be idiopathic or due to the effects of another disease, particularly COPD. This can lead to strain on the right side of the heart, a condition known as cor pulmonale. Pulmonary edema, leakage of fluid from capillaries of the lung into the alveoli (or air spaces). It is usually due to congestive heart failure. Pulmonary hemorrhage, inflammation and damage to capillaries in the lung resulting in blood leaking into the alveoli. This may cause blood to be coughed up. Pulmonary hemorrhage can be due to auto-immune disorders such as Wegener's Granulomatosis and Goodpasture's syndrome.\nPleural cavity diseases include empyema and mesothelioma which are mentioned above.\nA collection of fluid in the pleural cavity is known as a pleural effusion. This may be due to fluid shifting from the bloodstream into the pleural cavity due to conditions such as congestive heart failure and cirrhosis. It may also be due to inflammation of the pleura itself as can occur with infection, pulmonary embolus, tuberculosis, mesothelioma and other conditions.\nA pneumothorax is a hole in the pleura covering the lung allowing air in the lung to escape into the pleural cavity. The affected lung \u201ccollapses\u201d like a deflated balloon. A tension pneumothorax is a particularly severe form of this condition where the air in the pleural cavity cannot escape, so the pneumothorax keeps getting bigger until it compresses the heart and blood vessels, leading to a life threatening situation.\nThere are many other disorders that affect the lung and respiratory system. Auto-immune disorders such as vasculitis,(Wegener's Granulomatosis, Goodpasture's syndrome, for example) attack the blood vessels in the lung, causing pulmonary hemorrhage. Disorders in swallowing,or gastric refluxing can cause aspiration pneumonia."}

The positive properties of ouabain regarding the prophylaxis and treatment of these two indications are documented by a clutch of studies.  Ouabain isolated from plants is widely used by scientists in in vitro studies to specifically block the sodium pump (Na-K-ATPase). In many non-rodent species, low concentrations of this substance (i.e., in the subnanomolar range) may stimulate the Na-K-ATPase.

Moreover, pericardial friction rub may sometimes be present in patients with right atrial tumors. \nA \" tumor plop\" (a sound related to movement of the tumor) can be heard. This is defined as a protodiastolic murmur, it can be heard 80 to 150 msec after the second heart sound. Abnormal heart sounds, or murmurs may be heard. Sounds may change when the patient changes position. In patients with left atrial myxomas, S1 is often loud and widely split, because the tumor has caused a delay in the closure of the mitral valve. Diastolic murmurs are due to the obstruction of the left or right ventricle. Systolic murmurs are related to the narrow closure of the atrioventricular valves. In most cases, a common ascultatory finding is the accentuated first heart sound and the loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the cause of gonorrhea?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The exudates from infected individuals contain many polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with ingested gonococci. These gonococci stimulate the PMN to release an internal oxidative burst involving reactive oxygen species in order to kill the gonococci.  However, a significant fraction of the gonococci can resist killing and are able to reproduce within the PMN phagosomes.\nStohl and Seifert showed that the bacterial RecA protein, that mediates recombinational repair of DNA damage, plays an important role in gonococcal survival.  The protection afforded by RecA protein may be linked to transformation, the process by which recipient gonococci take up DNA from neighboring gonococci and integrate this DNA into the recipient genome through recombination. Michod et al. have suggested that an important benefit of transformation in N. gonorrhoeae may be recombinational repair of oxidative DNA damages caused by oxidative attack by the hosts phagocytic cells."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the explanation for the pathophysiology of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The most striking histopathological changes of aneurysmatic aorta are seen in tunica media and intima.  Changes indicated include an accumulation of lipids in foam cells (a kind of macrophage), extracellular free cholesterol crystals, calcifications, ulcerations, ruptures of the layers, and thrombosis.  There is an adventitial inflammatory infiltrate. The degradation of tunica media in proteolytic manners,is the basic process of abdominal aortic aneurysm initial phase.  Matrix metalloproteinases role in Abdominal aortic aneurysm has been shown by some researchers.  This leads to elimination of elastin from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of the blood pressure. Inflammation is another condition which plays a role in abdominal aortic aneurysm development. \nThe aortic wall has a specific arrangement of structural proteins that give it both strength and elasticity. The composition of the extracellular matrix protein in the media may change with age or in response to other conditions, therefore resulting in subsequent destruction of the elastic lamella, rendering the aorta less able to withstand the force of systolic pressure. The infra-renal aorta is more prone to develop aneurysms than other segments for the following reasons:  It is the segment that must expand the most during systole and contract the most during diastole. It has a thinner wall, and has fewer vasa vasora than the thoracic aorta. It is more prone to atherosclerosis, a proposed nidus for aneurysmal dilatation. Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) also have atherosclerosis in the aorta and other arteries, suggesting that aneurysmal disease may be part of a larger spectrum of vascular disease, and that atherosclerosis actually promotes AAA formation. In atherosclerotic AAA, inflammatory cells infiltrate into the vessel wall and may secrete specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  The different types of MMPs play diverse roles via complex interactions that eventually lead to degradation of the structural media proteins, and subsequently to aneurysmal dilatation. There are significantly fewer smooth muscle cells in human AAA tissues than in normal or atherosclerotic nonaneurysmal aortic tissue. This decrease in smooth muscle cells in suspected to be secondary to apoptosis, therefore suggesting a role for focal cell apoptosis in the pathogenesis of AAA."}

If your investigations are not suggestive of food allergy, I would think of digestion abnormality rather than allergy. In such patients, I usually suggest them to avoid the foods causing problems to them for 3 months and take probiotics and multivitamin-multimineral supplements during that period.Thereafter, I advise them to gradually introduce the foods which were withheld. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have further queried, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCould you please provide me with the original text to paraphrase?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The vast majority of chronic wounds can be classified into three categories: venous ulcers, diabetic, and pressure ulcers.   A small number of wounds that do not fall into these categories may be due to causes such as radiation poisoning or ischemia. \nVenous ulcers, which usually occur in the legs, account for about 70% to 90% of chronic wounds  and mostly affect the elderly. They are thought to be due to venous hypertension caused by improper function of valves that exist in the veins to prevent blood from flowing backward. Ischemia results from the dysfunction and, combined with reperfusion injury, causes the tissue damage that leads to the wounds.\nAnother major cause of chronic wounds, diabetes, is increasing in prevalence.  Diabetics have a 15% higher risk for amputation than the general population  due to chronic ulcers. Diabetes causes neuropathy, which inhibits the perception of pain.  Thus patients may not initially notice small wounds to legs and feet, and may therefore fail to prevent infection or repeated injury.  Further, diabetes causes immune compromise and damage to small blood vessels, preventing adequate oxygenation of tissue, which can cause chronic wounds.  Pressure also plays a role in the formation of diabetic ulcers. \nAnother leading type of chronic wounds is pressure ulcers,  which usually occur in people with conditions such as paralysis that inhibit movement of body parts that are commonly subjected to pressure such as the heels, shoulder blades, and sacrum.   Pressure ulcers are caused by ischemia that occurs when pressure on the tissue is greater than the pressure in capillaries, and thus restricts blood flow into the area.  Muscle tissue, which needs more oxygen and nutrients than skin does, shows the worst effects from prolonged pressure.  As in other chronic ulcers, reperfusion injury damages tissue."}

I am hepatobiliary surgeon and I have to say that death as a complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an extremely rare scenario, especially in younger and healthy people. This risk may be a bit higher in case of cholecystitis or cholangitis, but still this is pretty rare. Causes may be related to surgery or may be related to heart and lung function, Some surgical complications such as bleeding may lead to hemorrhagic shock and death in early postoperative period. Other such as infection would lead to longer period between surgery and death. Heart related complications include myocardial infarct which may happen as in any person. However, most common cause of sudden death is pulmonary embolism which can not easily be prevented and there are no some warning signs of it before or after surgery.

I have noted the details of your mother. It is unfortunate that she suffered a major stroke at a relatively young age. The cause of stroke is related to heart disease. The PT/INR is maintained by using adequate dose of warfarin or citron tablets. If the dose is less, the blood becomes thick, leading to ischemic stroke (lack of blood flow to the brain). The likely outcome and improvement depends on the exact location and size of stroke. So, if you can send the MRI or CT scan of brain report, it would be helpful in predicting the chances of recovery.

However, as with any invasive procedure, complications can occur. The major complications of PTCA/PCI include coronary artery dissection and acute closure, intramural hematoma, coronary artery perforation, and occlusion of branch vessels: Dissections are found in up to 50 percent of patients immediately after PTCA. Intimal tears or dissections following PTCA have been arbitrarily divided into types A to F.\nType A \u2014 Luminal haziness\nType B \u2014 Linear dissection\nType C \u2014 Extraluminal contrast staining\nType D \u2014 Spiral dissection\nType E \u2014 Dissection with reduced flow\nType F \u2014 Dissection with total occlusion\nThese problems are now much less frequent since stent placement is performed in most percutaneous coronary procedures. Abrupt closure is most often due to arterial dissection and is manifested as acute ischemic chest pain and ECG changes. The incidence of abrupt closure with conventional balloon angioplasty (PTCA) is approximately 5% and is associated with a 10-fold increase in mortality to about 1 percent and nonfatal MI. The frequency of this complication, however, has now been greatly reduced by pretreatment with the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockers and by the insertion of an intracoronary stent. If stenting does not restore adequate flow, emergency CABG can be performed.\nCoronary artery intramural hematoma is defined as an accumulation of blood within the medial space displacing the internal elastic membrane inward and the external elastic membrane outward, with or without identifiable entry and exit points. It is identified in 6.7 percent of procedures by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).\nCoronary artery perforation in the stent era is a rare but potentially disastrous complication.\nDownstream embolization of thrombus or plaque contents with microvascular obstruction is common after PCI and occlusion of side branches has been reported in up to 19 percent of cases in which a stent was placed across a major side branch.\nStent thrombosis is catastrophic complication that usually leads to death or ST segment elevation MI. It is therefore a medical emergency. Stent thrombosis can occur acutely (during or soon after the PCI), subacutely (within 30 days after stent placement), or as a complication. Late stent thrombosis is associated with the cessation of aspirin or clopidogrel therapy. On the other hand, very late stent thrombosis, occurring after one year, is associated with drug-eluting stents.\nRestenosis is the result of arterial damage with subsequent neointimal tissue proliferation. It is usually defined as a greater than 50% diameter stenosis. The incidence of angiographic restenosis is approximately 30% to 40% after PTCA. Intracoronary stents reduce the rate of angiographic and clinical restenosis and post-procedural myocardial infarction compared to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) alone. Trials have demonstrated that the sirolimus and paclitaxel drug-eluting stents markedly reduced the incidence of in-stent restenosis and the rate of target lesion revascularization compared to bare metal stents. As a result, stents are currently utilized in nearly all percutaneous coronary interventions. However, the benefits of drug-eluting stents on restenosis must be weighed against rates of stent thrombosis, which often leads to death or MI, if dual antiplatelet therapy is prematurely discontinued. Restenosis occurs more frequently in diabetics, smaller arteries, among total occlusions, and in left anterior descending arteries, particularly proximal lesions. Since not all angiographic restenosis results in recurrent symptoms, the rates of clinical restenosis are lower than these angiographic estimates. Recurrent sever angina occurs in approximately half of the patients who develop angiographic restenosis and usually responds to stenting. In symptomatic patients with BMS restenosis, a repeat stenting using a DES is usually recommended. In symptomatic patients with intracoronary DES restenosis, there are insufficient data to suggest any specific treatment.\nFor more information on complications during and following cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention, click here."}

There are umbilical hernia, inguinal hernia, incisional hernia, diaphragmatic hernia. If you tell us what hernia it is we will be able to advice you appropriately. In general, if a hernia had been fixed using only your tissues, there is a good chance of it coming back because the very first reason why you have a hernia is because your tissues are weak and let your organs go out of their position, so repairing a hernia with only your own tissue will likely lead to a hernia coming back especially for inguinal and umbilical hernias. So surgeons will repair certain hernias by using artificial tissues called mesh to reinforce your tissues. I advise that you see a specialist general surgeon."}

This period until diagnosis and treatment initiation is particularly important in the case of cardiogenic shock since the mortality rate of this condition complicating acute- MI is very high, along with the fact that the ability to revert the damage caused, through reperfusion techniques, declines considerably with diagnostic delays. Therefore and due to the unstable state of these patients, the diagnostic evaluations are usually performed as supportive measures are initiated. The diagnostic measures should start with the proper history and physical examination, including blood pressure measurement, followed by an EKG, echocardiography, chest x-ray and collection of blood samples for evaluation. The physician should keep in mind the common features of shock, irrespective of the type of shock, in order to avoid delays in the diagnosis. Although not all shock patients present in the same way, these features include: abnormal mental status, cool extremities, clammy skin, manifestations of hypoperfusion, such as hypotension and oliguria, as well as evidence of metabolic acidosis on the blood results."}

An excisional biopsy is needed because it preserves the architecture of the lymph node and allows for precise determination of the type of lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is insufficient. In addition to light microscopy evaluation of the excisional biopsy samples, the immunophenotypic analysis with immunohistochemistry helps to determine Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes and distinguish Hodgkin's lymphoma from T cell rich large B cell lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The presence of Reed-Sternberg cells is diagnostic for classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The Reed-Sternberg cells of classic Hodgkin's lymphoma particularly express CD15 and CD30 and do not present CD3 or CD45. Flow cytometry is an effective method in differentiating between classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma, and T cell rich large B cell lymphoma based upon the presence of specific T cell populations. \nA bone marrow biopsy can also be done to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma if there is sufficient evidence of marrow involvement (i.e. presence of cytopenias). Hodgkin lymphoma cells originate in the bone marrow, which is the site of B cell production and maturation. A length of 2cm of the core biopsy is generally needed for diagnosis, which is in contrast to diagnostic requirements for leukemias. A bone marrow is not the diagnostic study of choice for Hodgkin lymphoma if a lymph node can be biopsied."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the explanation for blood and physiology? \n\nThere is no grammatical error in the original sentence. However, it could be rephrased to sound more natural, such as:\n\nCan you explain the relationship between blood and physiology?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow; this process is termed hematopoiesis. The proteinaceous component (including clotting proteins) is produced overwhelmingly in the liver, while hormones are produced by the endocrine glands and the watery fraction is regulated by the hypothalamus and maintained by the kidney and indirectly by the gut.\nBlood cells are degraded by the spleen and the Kupffer cells in the liver. The liver also clears some proteins, lipids and amino acids. The kidney actively secretes waste products into the urine. Healthy erythrocytes have a plasma half-life of 120 days before they are systematically replaced by new erythrocytes created by the process of hematopoiesis.\nBlood oxygenation is measured in several ways, but the most important measure is the hemoglobin (Hb) saturation percentage. This is a non-linear (sigmoidal) function of the partial pressure of oxygen. About 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at normal pressure is chemically combined with the Hb. Only 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to Hb. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species (for exceptions, see below).\nWith the exception of pulmonary and umbilical arteries and their corresponding veins, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and deliver it to the body via arterioles and capillaries, where the oxygen is consumed; afterwards, venules and veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.\nDifferences in infrared absorption between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood form the basis for realtime oxygen saturation measurement in hospitals and ambulances.\nUnder normal conditions in humans at rest, hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98-99% saturated with oxygen. In a healthy adult at rest, deoxygenated blood returning to the lungs is still approximately 75% saturated.   Increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions.  Oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia): \"As a general rule, any condition which leads to a sustained mixed venous saturation of less than 50% will be poorly tolerated and a mixed venous saturation of less than 30% should be viewed as a medical emergency.\" \nA fetus, receiving oxygen via the placenta, is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found in an adult's lungs) and so fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (hemoglobin F) in order to function under these conditions. \nSubstances other than oxygen can bind to the hemoglobin; in some cases this can cause irreversible damage to the body. Carbon monoxide for example is extremely dangerous when absorbed into the blood. When combined with the hemoglobin, it irreversibly makes carboxyhemoglobin which reduces the volume of oxygen that can be carried in the blood. This can very quickly cause suffocation, as oxygen is vital to many organisms (including humans). This damage can occur when smoking a cigarette (or similar item) or in event of a fire. Thus carbon monoxide is considered far more dangerous than the actual fire itself because it reduces the oxygen carrying content of the blood.\nIn insects, the blood (more properly called hemolymph) is not involved in the transport of oxygen. (Openings called tracheae allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues). Insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system.\nOther invertebrates use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen carrying capacity. Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature. Hemocyanin (blue) contains copper and is found in crustaceans and mollusks. It is thought that tunicates (sea squirts) might use vanabins (proteins containing vanadium) for respiratory pigment (bright green, blue, or orange).\nIn many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood; in vertebrates they are contained in specialized red blood cells, allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing viscosity or damaging blood filtering organs like the kidneys.\nGiant tube worms have extraordinary hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments. These hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals.\nWhen systemic arterial blood flows through capillaries, carbon dioxide diffuses from the tissues into the blood. Some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood. Some carbon dioxide reacts with hemoglobin and other proteins to form carbamino compounds. The remaining carbon dioxide is converted to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions through the action of RBC carbonic anhydrase. Most carbon dioxide is transported through the blood in the form of bicarbonate ions.\nSome oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin has a much greater affinity for hydrogen ion (H +) than does oxyhemoglobin so it binds most of the hydrogen ions.\nBlood circulation transports heat through the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of thermoregulation. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g. during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss, while decreasing surface blood flow conserves heat.\nThe restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement resulting in an erection of that tissue. Examples of this would occur in a mammalian penis, clitoris or nipple.\nAnother example of a hydraulic function is the jumping spider, in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump.\nIn humans and other hemoglobin-using creatures, oxygenated blood is bright red. This is due to oxygenated iron-containing hemoglobin found in the red blood cells. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red, which can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken.\nThe blood of most molluscs, and some arthropods such as horseshoe crabs, is blue. This is a result of its high content of copper-based hemocyanin instead of the iron-based hemoglobin found, for example, in mammals. While mammalian blood is never blue, there is a rare condition (sulfhemoglobinemia) that results in green blood. Skinks in the genus Prasinohaema have green blood due to a buildup of the waste product biliverdin."}

FM does not cause inflammation, arthritis, skin rashes, or damage to tissues, organs and bones like lupus. Medications commonly used to treat lupus have little or no effect on the symptoms of FM. People with lupus often suffer from the symptoms of FM or may be initially diagnosed as having FM. If you have FM, it is important to know that it is not rare. FM is never life-threatening, and it is manageable. The clinical assessment may reveal objective evidence for a discrete illness, such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematous (SHE), polymyalgia rheumatic, or another inflammatory or autoimmune disorder. Such findings do not exclude comorbid fibromyalgia. Indeed, approximately 25% of patients with RA and approximately 50% of patients with SHE also have fibromyalgia, and the provision of optimum care in such cases impels recognition and treatment of both illnesses."}

Viral parotitis is caused by the infiltration of respiratory droplets containing the mumps virus. The mumps HN and F glycoproteins reach the surface of the infected host cell through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Virions emerge from the infected cells due to the M protein facilitating the localization of the viral ribonucleic proteins onto the host cell membrane. Both HN and F glycoproteins mediate the fusion of virus and host cell, as well as cell and cell - membrane fusion, to perpetuate the spread of the virus throughout the host. The virus replicates in the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes. Upon replication, viremia occurs for three to five days, spreading to the salivary glands. Parotitis results from the inflammatory response tp the presence of mumps virus in the parotid salivary gland. Bacterial parotitis is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus."}

First, assess your body. Which muscles are weak and which area needs more workout. Then, always start exercising with the mat exercises which includes simple leg raise, hand raise, static quads, static hams, static triceps and static biceps, breathing and core stability. Post which starts with simple standing exercise. Then proceed to aerobics and then to anaerobic. Planning the exercises beforehand step by step is always better than trying just the articles.

I am Chat Doctor answering your query. It is good that you have started passing the broken pieces of the kidney stone without any discomfort. There could be two reasons for your urologist for advising you to collect the broken pieces : 1) Maybe he is suspecting some kind of pigment stones, and because some are formed again and again, they want to test the composition of the stone to judge its chances of recurrence and manage accordingly.  2) Your urologist may want to be sure that the stone is out in toto. So they can reconstruct the collected pieces to see if that completes the original stone.  I hope I have answered your query. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor forum for your health questions.

The cavernous sinus drains by two larger channels, the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, ultimately into the internal jugular vein via the sigmoid sinus, also draining with emissary vein to pterygoid plexus. These sinuses are just lateral and superior to the sphenoid sinus and are immediately posterior to the optic chiasm. Each cavernous sinus is formed between layers of the dura mater, and multiple connections exist between the 2 sinuses.  \nIt is understood that the main cause of cavernous sinus thrombosis is bacterial infection s.   Staphylococcus aureus may account for two-thirds of cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis. Other typical organisms include:   Streptococcus species (approximately 20% of cases) Pneumococcus (5%) Gram-negative species such as Proteus Hemophilus Pseudomonas Fusobacterium Bacteroides Gram-positive species such as Corynebacterium and Actinomyces\nIn cavernous sinus thrombosis, a blood clot develops in the sinus cavernous structure to prevent the infection from spreading to brain, but it often blocks the blood flow out of the brain.  \nSeptic cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis are usually caused by central facial infections, especially within the danger triangle of the face (from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose).   The main sources of infection include:  Mastoiditis  Otitis media  Abscess  Cellulitis  Sinusitis  Dental infections or procedures (even a posterior superior alveolar nerve block entering the pterygoid plexus) \nThe other rare causes of cavernous sinus thrombosis include: Fungal infection s  Severe head injuries  Autoimmune conditions such as lupus  Pregnancy"}

In botany, the term is also used to announce a condition of thickened surfaces of leaves or other plant parts. Since repeated contact is required, calluses are most often found on hands or feet. Calluses are generally not harmful, but may sometimes lead to other problems, such as infection. Shoes that fit tightly can often produce calluses on the feet. String instrument players develop calluses where their fingers make contact with the strings, but these calluses are often desirable as they help alleviate the pain from the tension of the strings and make playing easier. Dancers often develop calluses on the soles of their feet from dancing barefoot, which makes performing turns less difficult. Video game players may develop calluses on their thumbs, especially if using a controller with a poor D-pad. Frequent use of a writing implement may lead to a callus on the middle finger, commonly known as a \"writer's bump\"."}

The fever has been brought down appropriately, but we still have to treat cause of the fever. The sign that you mention, pain in the back of head down to the nape of her neck, is indicating that she may have an infection in the throat.check if she has pain on moving her neck down in front.shine a torch inside her throat and see if it is red. I suggest that in addition to simple remedies of bringing down fever, see a pediatrician and get her examined .she may need blood tests like blood counts and close follow up next few days. She may also need admission, further tests to rule out an infection called meningitis and correct early antibiotics to get rid of bacteria. I am sure she will get better soon."}

As you did not mention a history of direct trauma, I assume that these bruises have been developed by themselves. This problem is not related to Lyme, articular low back pain, increased blood pressure and anemia.  This is not a problem that you can ignore or treat by yourself. You should refer to an internal medicine specialist first to check for coagulation problems (disorders that increase the tendency to bleeding.) He/She will order some lab data such as PT, PTT, BT, CBC with PLT and may be Protein S a Protein C. Also, check your urine to see if its color is changed to orange or red.

I have gone through your query. Your persistent knee pain can be due to injury of internal structures of knee like meniscus or ligaments. A physical examination by an orthopedic will be helpful to rule out this. In case of positive signs you may need to do X-ray followed by MRI if necessary. Mild to moderate injuries can be managed conservatively. But if severe then diagnostic arthroscopy and correction is advised. You can manage knee pain by giving ice pack application, giving knee immobilization by wearing knee braces for short periods and qua Chat Doctor.

Raised monocyte count is seen in both non-neoplastic and neoplastic disorders. Non-neoplastic disorders include chronic infections like malaria, leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, etc. These infections are more common in tropical countries and absent in temperate countries.Non-infectious include multiple sclerosis, etc. Neoplastic diseases include leukemia. A peripheral blood examination and other relevant systemic investigations will help further. Low hemoglobin can occur due to dietary deficiency or due to decreased production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Red cell indices - MTV, MCH, MHC, RDW need to be done to know the cause of low hemoglobin. Low backache can occur due to bad posture, skeletal muscle strain, or due to some pathology in the bones. In the presence of high monocytes and low hemoglobin, there is possibility of bone marrow involvement by leukemia. Consult a hematologist for further work up. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "}

In kids like you, this center does not know when to stop and this makes us constantly hungry and this in turn adds to our weight. There are millions of kids like you all over the world, and you are not the only one having this problem. What makes a difference is the STRONG WILL to limit food intake specially the ones we like most such as ice-creams, chocolates, deep-fried items etc. It would be healthy if you could replace these things with fruits and vegetables and make special effort to move out and play and interact with your friends and if possible go for regular swimming.

There are many types of surgeries that can be done to help control the pain that you are suffering from but none of them can be attempted before you get that MRI. The Surgeon needs to know what kind of nerve compression is causing the pain and the stiffness and needs to be able to plan out the surgery using the pictures that are given with the MRI. Now when it comes to insurance. I am no expert on health insurance and I wish I had some easy quick fix place that you could go to. My best advice is to check in with your local Public clinic (which I'm betting you have already done). The only other thing I could possibly suggest is that you look to getting treated in another country. There are companies that can arrange for travel and surgery to other countries to get treatment at a fraction of the cost of the same treatment in the United States. The whole concept is called medical tourism. You could look into it if you want. See if that works out better for you. I hope this helps. Thanks for coming to Chat Doctor .com"}

This syndrome can be classified into primary (no underlying disease state) and secondary (in association with an underlying disease state) types. The underlying mechanism of APS mediated by the antibodies is mainly mediated via their affect on the coagulation cascade which subsequenlty leads to increased vascular tone of thrombosis.

There are no donor sites in the human body with a similar kind of tissue. The turbinates and nasal mucosa are unique.\nDaily irrigation and a healthy life style can slow down the progression of atrophy in-case of rhinitis sicca and atrophic rhinitis, and can help cope with the symptoms of ENS.\nThere are different types of treatment available for ENS. Saline (physiological salt water, 0.9% sodium-chloride) can be used to rinse out the dry mucus and moisten the nasal cavity, this could also prevent infection. Some people find relief by increasing nasal secretions by consuming large amounts of dairy products. Vitamin A and D might help with mucus production. Humidifiers can be used to help with the dryness, and in cases of sleep disordered breathing a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine with a built-in humidifier can be used. Nasal salves sooth the anterior aspects of the nasal cavity and help to reduce disease susceptablity Nisita. Acupuncture, shiatsu, inversion therapy, regular physical exercise - all these will improve the blood circulation to the nose and help preserve the remaining nasal mucosa.\nAll the above non-surgical treatments will help improve dryness conditions, and sustain the health of the remaining membranes, but they will not restore the lost functions or the nose and normal nasal sensations.\nENS, can be improved to varying degrees of success, though not fully cured, by trying to fabricate the structure and quality of the missing turbinates, with implants made of all sorts of materials from self donated living tissues such as bone and cartilage fragments, followed by artificial materials like - plastipore and hydroxyapetite cement and recently also biomaterials such as Alloderm and/or SIS.\nIf a significant portion of a turbinate remains, it can be augmented with bio-materials such as acellular dermis (\"Alloderm\") and SIS, two known natural biomaterials with low absorption and rejection rates. Once either of these materials is implanted in the desired area, the implants incorporate into the surrounding tissue and adopt many of the host tissue's qualities. Even if the turbinates are totally resected there is still much that can be achieved by narrowing the nasal airway at key-strategic locations with submucosal implants that will normalize airway resistance, trap moisture and increase humidifcation, and will deflect the airflow to flow more calmly and steadily. The implants help to normalize the nasal pressures and aerodynamics of airflow, restore normal nasal sensations, and improve nasal humidity. Common places for effective implantation, other than to the turbinates, is opposite the resected turbinates, inot the septum or nasal floor (see example in pictures below). The nasal lateral wall can be augmented to. Other materials can be used as implants, but none have shown the same level of success as Alloderm. Today there is also a new approved form of micronized Alloderm, brand-named Cymetra, that can be injected in liquid form. Once it is in place it solidifies and becomes like regular Alloderm. It is difficult or virtually impossible to use Cymetra on its own to achieve a large volume implant, but it can be used successfully to further augment prior Alloderm implants, thus perfecting the initial result achieved with regular Alloderm.\nAlloderm implants have already been implanted successfully for a few years now in a small but growing number of ENS patients. At four years follow-up, results seem stable and encouraging. It seems that Alloderm implants can't fully cure ENS but can help alleviate the symptoms with various degrees of success, depending on the individual condition of each patient. \nHopefully, as doctors become more aware of ENS, they will reach a better understanding of its long-term effects on its sufferers' quality of life. This will hopefully encourage more surgeons to develop better ways of reconstructing resected nasal turbinates and to normalize the contours and function of the inner nasal airway anatomy and physiology."}

The diagnosis rests on the microscopic identification of larvae (rhabditiform and occasionally filariform) in the stool. Single ova and parasite examination can have negative results in up to 70% of cases. Repeated examinations of stool specimens increase the chances of detecting larvae. The diagnostic sensitivity increases to 50% with three stool examinations and can approach 100% if seven serial stool samples are examined Specialized stool examinations techniques include Baermann concentration, Horadi-Mori filter paper culture, quantitative acetate concentration technique, and nutrient agar plate cultures. Diagnostic characteristics: length 200 to 250 \u00b5m (up to 380 \u00b5m) Short buccal cavity Prominent genital primordium.\nImmunodiagnostic tests for strongyloidiasis are indicated when the infection is suspected and the organism cannot be demonstrated by duodenal aspiration, string tests, or by repeated examinations of stool. Antibody detection tests should use antigens derived from Strongyloides stercoralis filariform larvae for the highest sensitivity and specificity. Although indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests have been used, Immunocompromised persons with disseminated strongyloidiasis usually have detectable IgG antibodies despite their immunosuppression. Cross-reactions in patients with filariasis and other nematode infections can occur. Antibody test results cannot be used to differentiate between the past and current infection. A positive test warrants continuing efforts to establish a parasitological diagnosis followed by antihelminthic treatment. Serologic monitoring may be useful in the follow-up of immunocompetent treated patients: antibody levels decrease markedly within 6 months after successful chemotherapy.  More sensitive and specific serologic tests using recombinant antigens have been and are being developed, and are available at specific laboratories. An additional advantage of these serologic tests is that there is typically a significant drop in titer by 6 months after parasite eradication, which may make it possible to use these tests as a check the response to medical therapy.\n{{#ev:youtube|TSwN602mcn4}}\nSerology can be useful but is not commonly available and can give false-negative results.

Talk to your doctor before implementing any of these approaches, especially those that involve taking a medication or supplement.\nConsume a low-fat diet. Eat cold-water fish (like tuna, salmon, and mackerel) rich in omega-3 fatty acids at least 2 to 3 times per week. Reduce your intake of linoleic acid, which is found in margarine, butter, and dairy products. Increase consumption of antioxidants like carotenoids, vitamin E, and vitamin C by eating plenty of darkly colored fruits and vegetables. Maintain a normal blood pressure.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat are the risks of developing cardiac disease during pregnancy and in people who have undergone surgical repair for congenital heart disease?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Individuals with TOF usually present very early in life with cyanosis making it necessary to undergo surgical repair. The repair is is almost always done during infancy, particularly in developed countries. During the surgery, the pulmonary valve and right ventricular outflow tract are both surgically dilated. This usually leads to pulmonary valve regurgitation as well as arrhythmias originating from the right side of the heart. Therefore, subsequent right sided heart failure is sometimes observed. 20 years following repair of Tetralogy of Fallot, 10-15% of patients develop late complications, the most important of which is right sided heart failure.   \nSome TOF patients will have a palliative surgically-created systemic-pulmonary shunt such as Blalock-Taussig or Waterston, but without corrective surgery.  In such situations, pregnancy might worsen an already existing right-to-left shunt (through a VSD) by reducing the systemic vascular resistance, leading to worsening cyanosis. In previous studies, maternal NYHA functional class > 2 and cyanosis are identified as independent predictors of both maternal and fetal complications.  Therefore, worsening cyanosis is not favored in such patients and pregnancy should be avoided.\nElements to be evaluated for through history, physical exam, EKG and echocardiogram prior to pregnancy (in women with surgical correction): 1. Residual pulmonary regurgitation and severity 2. Residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction 3. Right sided heart failure 4. Tricuspid regurgitation 5. Atrial or ventricular arrhythmias 6. VSD\nGenerally, it is accepted that most women with corrected TOF can have non-restricted lifestyle and tolerate pregnancy. However, they still need to be evaluated by a cardiologist prior to and during pregnancy. Women with severe pulmonary regurgitation as a complication of the corrective surgery might benefit from pulmonary valve replacement prior to pregnancy to reduce possibility of complications."}

Now at age 38 he doesn t use but can his right hand. He just recently went to the doctor an they diagnosed him with having MS. However then sent him to a neurologist an he diagnosed him with Corticobasal ganglion degeneration I feel like he had a stroke an it went undiagnosed.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "I read your question and I understand your concern. To be honest I am very puzzled by your story, especially the corticobasal ganglion degeneration (CBG) part. CBG typically presents around the age of 60. The youngest ever documented case has manifested at the age of 34 (I rechecked before answering just to be sure). So if your son had that disease at 38 with manifestations starting at 35, he would be an almost unique case in the history of the disease, I would be really careful in taking that diagnosis. As for the distinction between MS and stroke related to the head trauma it should generally be easy with an MRI if history and examination do not already make that distinction. Without knowing more about the signs and MRI report it's hard for me to say something more because these diseases can have many presentations. The seizure would direct more towards the head trauma rather than MS, as would the fact that the deficit has remained constant in time since the hit, without new signs, as you seem to suggest, but as I said MRI and more details are needed. I hope things work out for the best."}

For individual patients, tests are most useful when they are likely to give results that will help with diagnosis and treatment decisions. During a respiratory illness outbreak in a closed setting, such as hospitals, nursing home, cruise ship testing for influenza can be very helpful in determining if influenza is the cause of the outbreak. Preferred respiratory samples for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal or nasal swab, and nasal wash or aspirate, depending on which type of test is used. Samples should be collected within the first 4 days of illness. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests provide results within 15 minutes or less; viral culture provides results in 3-10 days. Most of the rapid influenza diagnostic tests that can be done in a physician\u2019s office are approximately 50-70% sensitive for detecting influenza and approximately greater than 90% specific.\nThe following table shows routine laboratory findings that may be present among some patients, but normal laboratory findings are also seen."}

The clinical features of Graves' disease generally worsen without treatment, the mortality from Graves' disease was 10\u201330% before the introduction of satisfactory therapy. Some patients with mild Graves\u2019 disease experience spontaneous relapses and remissions.\nOlder patients are more vulnerable to develop cardiovascular complications compared to younger patients.  When compared with people older than 60 years with a healthy thyroid, those who are hyperthyroid have three times the risk of atrial fibrillation.  Embolic stroke related to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism is significantly more prevalent than embolic stroke related to atrial fibrillation from non-thyroidal causes.  AF is considered as an independent risk factor for CHF in patients with Graves' disease. \nCardiac manifestations of Graves' disease include palpitations, anginal chest pain, exercise intolerance, atrial fibrillation, exertional dyspnea, cardiac hypertrophy, systolic hypertension, peripheral edema, hyperdynamic precordium, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. \nThere is a shift of potassium into the muscle cells. \nIt is characterized by the triad of muscle paralysis, acute hypokalemia and thyrotoxicosis.\nThe clinical course of ophthalmopathy does not follow that of the thyroid disease. Ophthalmopathy typically worsens over the initial 3\u20136 months, followed by a plateau phase over the next 12\u201318 months, with spontaneous improvement.  The earliest manifestations of ophthalmopathy are usually a sensation of grittiness, eye discomfort, and excess tearing. Approximately one third of patients have proptosis. Proptosis can be measured using an exophthalmometer. In severe cases, proptosis may cause corneal exposure and damage, especially if the lids fail to close during sleep. Periorbital edema, scleral injection, and chemosis are also frequent. In 5\u201310% of patients, the muscle swelling is so severe that diplopia results. The most serious manifestation is compression of the optic nerve at the apex of the orbit, leading to papilledema, peripheral field defects, and permanent loss of vision if left untreated. \nIt occurs in <5% of patients with Graves\u2019 disease. The typical lesion is a noninflamed, indurated plaque with a deep pink or purple color and an orange skin appearance. Nodular involvement can occur and the condition can rarely extend over the whole lower leg and foot, mimicking elephantiasis. Thyroid acropachy refers to a form of clubbing found in <1% of patients with Graves\u2019 disease. \n\nThyroid crisis is a life threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, manifested by fever, delirium, seizures, coma, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice. The mortality rate due to cardiac failure, arrhythmia, or hyperthermia is as high as 30%, even with treatment. Thyrotoxic crisis is usually precipitated by acute illness (e.g., stroke, infection, trauma, diabetic ketoacidosis), surgery (especially on the thyroid), or radioiodine treatment of a patient with partially treated or untreated hyperthyroidism.\nThe overall prognosis with treatment is good."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCan you provide an explanation for Pulse and Overview?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Pulse is the throbbing of the arteries as an effect of the heart beat. It can be felt in any place that allows for an artery to be compressed against a bone, such as at the neck (carotid artery), at the wrist (radial artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), on the inside of the elbow (brachial artery), and near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery). The pulse rate can also be measured by measuring the heart beats directly (the apical pulse).\nPressure waves move the artery walls, which are pliable; these waves are not caused by the forward movement of the blood. When the heart contracts, blood is ejected into the aorta and the aorta stretches. At this point, the wave of distention (pulse wave) is pronounced but relatively slow-moving (3\u20136 m/s). As it travels towards the peripheral blood vessels, it gradually diminishes and becomes faster. In the large arterial branches, its velocity is 7\u201310 m/s; in the small arteries, it is 15\u201335 m/s. The pressure pulse is transmitted fifteen or more times more rapidly than the blood flow.\nPulse is also used, although incorrectly, to denote the frequency of the heart beat, usually measured in beats per minute. In most people, the pulse is an accurate measure of heart rate. Under certain circumstances, including arrhythmias, some of the heart beats are ineffective, and the aorta is not stretched enough to create a palpable pressure wave. The pulse is too irregular and the heart rate can be (much) higher than the pulse rate. In this case, the heart rate should be determined by auscultation of the heart apex, in which case it is not the pulse. The pulse deficit (difference between heart beats and pulsations at the periphery) should be determined by simultaneous palpation at the radial artery and auscultation at the heart apex.\nA normal pulse rate for a healthy adult, while resting, can range from 60 to 100 beats per minute (BPM), although well conditioned athletes may have a healthy pulse rate lower than 60 BPM. Bradycardia occurs when the pulse rate is below 60 per minute, whereas tachycardia occurs when the rate is above 100 BPM. During sleep, this can drop to as low as 40 BPM; during strenuous exercise, it can rise as high as 150\u2013200 BPM. Generally, pulse rates are higher in infants and young children. The resting heart rate for an infant is usually close to an adult's pulse rate during strenuous exercise (average 110 BPM for an infant).\nA collapsing pulse is a sign of hyperdynamic circulation."}

Studies have evaluated the pre-test probability of endocarditis based upon signs and symptoms to predict occult endocarditis among patients with intravenous drug abuse    and among non drug abusing patients  . Unfortunately, this research is over 20 years old and it is possible that changes in the epidemiology of endocarditis and bacteria such as staphylococcus make the following estimates incorrectly low.\nAmong patients who do not use illicit drugs and have a fever in the emergency room, there is a less than 5% chance of occult endocarditis. Mellors  in 1987 found no cases of endocarditis nor of staphylococcal bacteremia among 135 febrile patients in the emergency room. The upper confidence interval for 0% of 135 is 5%, so for statistical reasons alone, there is up to a 5% chance of endocarditis among these patients. In contrast, Leibovici  found that among 113 non-selected adults admitted to the hospital because of fever there were two cases (1.8% with 95%CI: 0% to 7%) of endocarditis.\nAmong patients who do use illicit drugs and have a fever in the emergency room, there is about a 10% to 15% prevalence of endocarditis. This estimate is not substantially changed by whether the doctor believes the patient has a trivial explanation for their fever . Weisse  found that 13% of 121 patients had endocarditis. Marantz  also found a prevalence of endocarditis of 13% among such patients in the emergency room with fever. Samet  found a 6% incidence among 283 such patients, but after excluding patients with initially apparent major illness to explain the fever (including 11 cases of manifest endocarditis), there was a 7% prevalence of endocarditis.\nAmong patients with staphylococcal bacteremia (SAB), one study found a 29% prevalence of endocarditis in community-acquired SAB versus 5% in nosocomial SAB . However, only 2% of strains were resistant to methicillin and so these numbers may be low in areas of higher resistance."}

After recent unprotected sex with my current girlfriend I noticed some pimple like bumps on the side of my penis... It started as two one on the mid right side and one on the mid left side.... The recent bout of sex was vigorous and slightly rough so I figured it was due to that and chalked it up as ingrown hairs or just zits... The bumps formed white heads and all but popped on their own. they appeared 1-2 days after this sexual instance. 2 more days went by and as I went to urinate I noticed the same bumps some with white heads, some without spread all around my groin area... Not in clusters but individual bumps scattered midway up my penis shaft to the base, above my penis in my pubic hair as high as my waistband of my boxers, on the upper inner part of both thighs almost in the crease of my groin. I am concerned it might be hsv 2. The bumps will pop and become tender afterwards but not any excruciating pain. They pop with clear pus normally no blood, and they hurt when popped to the point that I don t want to squeeze them all the way to fully drain them. My girlfriend said she got tested 3 months ago and was completely clean. she also is very trustworthy( I know many may doubt this but trust em she is) and she hasn t been with anyone else since being checked out. Is it possible for me to have an std from someone else long before that lied dormant until it was triggered by our recent spat of rough sex? I haven t slept with anyone else win over a year.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi, .HSV 2 is usually appeared in groups and confined to localized area and not spread over widely. They usually develop into grouped ulcers which remain for a week or so. It will not contain pus, only clear fluid. So you present lesions are unlikely to be due HSV 2 as they extended up to your pubic area and contains pus. Possibilities of hair folliculitis can be thought of. Oral antibiotics for a week or so along with some topical creams contains either antibiotic or antiseptic. Use of antiseptic soaps also would help. You consult your physician, confirm the diagnosis, rule out STDs with investigation and plan for the management. Get well soon.  Chat Doctor. Morgan"}

Associated muscle pain suggests a swelling arising from muscles. A clinical assessment of the swelling is required. Imaging of the upper thigh is also required to know the origin and extent of the swelling. After imaging study, aspiration cytology of the swelling is required. In aspiration cytology, cells are aspirated, spread on slide and stained with appropriate stains. By studying the stained cells, the origin and nature of the swelling can be assessed, and thus appropriate treatment can be instituted. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "}

Treating diarrhea promptly. Lubricating the anal canal with KY Jelly or other water-based lubrication before inserting anything (ex: vibrator, penis) into your anal canal. Petroleum jelly is not recommended because it can harbor harmful bacteria. Avoiding straining or prolonged sitting on the toilet. Using a moist wipe instead of perfumed and harsh toilet paper. Keeping the anus dry and hygienic. When using Analpram (cream), do not use the dispenser which can injure the area. Instead, use a finger to insert a pea size amount of cream. Carmex lip ointment (the version without sunscreen-protection chemicals) also helps and is much less expensive than Analpram ($70.00 small tube)."}

It is unlikely to transmit the rabies virus, if any. Rabies virus is found in the brain and the salivary secretions of these animals. So a cat bite by animals teeth with saliva is more likely to transmit the virus if the animal is found to be carrying the virus. But in your case you had scratches by the animals claws resulting in bleeding, so it is unlikely to result in the transmission of the virus and hence no chance of getting the rabies. What you need at the most is cleaning of the wound with soap and water or antiseptic like Provide and a booster dose of Injection Tetanus toxic and maybe you need a course of appropriate antibiotic from the doctor.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\nI have been diagnosed with h pylori. I m on triple therapy. It s my third day of taking this therapy. Problem started with a stitch like pain in my left side waist. Had some painful gas over the next week and took GasX. One week ago I had such bad and painful trapped gas in my stomach that I thought I was having a heart attack! Could not stand up straight and felt nauseous. After one hour the GasX worked and I did numerous huge burps which got rid of it. Nice! Gas kept coming back though at random times daily for the next few days until I went to the doctor. I also have a gallstone and am worried that my symptoms maybe related to that rather than the h pylori. How long does triple therapy take to start symptom relief? Should I carry on taking all these meds or have testing to determine the root cause of my symptoms? I m taking 1000mg amoxicillin, 20mg omeprezole and 500g clarithromycin twice daily. I have diarrhea (started today), original pain in left side waist still, and intermittent gas/bloating. I woke up with gas/indegestion this morning. Thanks.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi I read carefully all your concerns, and I am so sorry for your situation. In regard to you symptoms it seems to be related with the start of triple therapy. Antibiotics that you are using have side effects like gas, bloating etc. The antibiotics change your normal microbial flora of intestine. Diarrhea is another side effect of antibiotics (amoxicillin, claritromicine) therapy at this situation I would recommend you to start probiotics, take plenty of water, take Tibetan and HY Chat Doctor. The side effects of antibiotics can start even after the first dose. If this is not enough please consult gastroenterologist and perform other exams like abdominal ultrasound(related to your gallstone), blood work, and fecal analysis. Hope it is helpful"}

Aspirin should be administered to UA / NSTEMI patients as soon as possible after hospital presentation and continued indefinitely in patients who tolerate it. (Level of Evidence: A) 2. Clopidogrel (loading dose followed by daily maintenance dose) should be administered to UA / NSTEMI patients who are unable to take ASA because of hypersensitivity or major gastrointestinal intolerance. (Level of Evidence: A) 3. Patients with definite UA / NSTEMI at medium or high risk and in whom an initial invasive strategy is selected should receive dual-antiplatelet therapy on presentation. (Level of Evidence: A) ASA should be initiated on presentation. (Level of Evidence: A) The choice of a second antiplatelet therapy to be added to ASA on presentation includes 1 of the following: Before PCI: Clopidogrel (Level of Evidence: B); or An IV GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. (Level of Evidence: A) IV eptifibatide or tirofiban are the preferred GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. At the time of PCI: Clopidogrel if not started before PCI (Level of Evidence: A); or Prasugrel (Level of Evidence: B); or An IV GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. (Level of Evidence: A) 4. For UA / NSTEMI patients in whom an initial invasive strategy is selected, antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin should be initiated before diagnostic angiography (upstream) with either clopidogrel (loading dose followed by daily maintenance dose) or an intravenous GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. (Level of Evidence: A) Abciximab as the choice for upstream GP IIb/IIIa therapy is indicated only if there is no appreciable delay to angiography and PCI is likely to be performed; otherwise, IV eptifibatide or tirofiban is the preferred choice of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. (Level of Evidence: B) 5. For UA / NSTEMI patients in whom an initial conservative strategy is selected, if recurrent symptoms/ ischemia, HF, or serious arrhythmias subsequently appear, then diagnostic angiography should be performed. (Level of Evidence: A). Either an IV GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide or tirofiban Level of Evidence: A) or clopidogrel (loading dose followed by daily maintenance dose Level of Evidence: B) should be added to ASA and anticoagulant therapy before diagnostic angiography (upstream). (Level of Evidence: C) 6. A loading dose of thienopyridine is recommended for UA / NSTEMI patients for whom PCI is planned. Regimens should be one of the following: Clopidogrel 300 to 600 mg should be given as early as possible before or at the time of PCI (Level of Evidence: A) or Prasugrel 60 mg should be given promptly and no later than 1 hour after PCI once coronary anatomy is defined and a decision is made to proceed with PCI. (Level of Evidence: B) 7. The duration and maintenance dose of thienopyridine therapy should be as follows: In UA / NSTEMI patients undergoing PCI, clopidogrel 75 mg daily or prasugrel 10 mg daily should be given for at least 12 months. (Level of Evidence: B) If the risk of morbidity because of bleeding outweighs the anticipated benefits afforded by thienopyridine therapy, earlier discontinuation should be considered. (Level of Evidence: C) Class IIa 1. For UA / NSTEMI patients in whom an initial conservative strategy is selected and who have recurrent ischemic discomfort with clopidogrel, ASA, and anticoagulant therapy, it is reasonable to add a GP IIb/IIIa antagonist before diagnostic angiography. (Level of Evidence: C) 2. For UA / NSTEMI patients in whom an initial invasive strategy is selected, it is reasonable to omit administration of an IV GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor if bivalirudin is selected as the anticoagulant and at least 300 mg of clopidogrel was administered at least 6 hours earlier than planned catheterization or PCI. (Level of Evidence: B) Class IIb 1. For UA / NSTEMI patients in whom an initial conservative (i.e., noninvasive) strategy is selected, it may be reasonable to add eptifibatide or tirofiban to anticoagulant and oral antiplatelet therapy. (Level of Evidence: B) 2. Prasugrel 60 mg may be considered for administration promptly upon presentation in patients with UA / NSTEMI for whom PCI is planned, before definition of coronary anatomy if both the risk for bleeding is low and the need for CABG is considered unlikely. (Level of Evidence: C) 3. The use of upstream GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in high-risk UA / NSTEMI patients already receiving ASA and a thienopyridine who are selected for an invasive strategy, such as those with elevated troponin levels, diabetes, or significant ST-segment depression, and who are not otherwise at high risk for bleeding. (Level of Evidence: B) 4. In patients with definite UA / NSTEMI undergoing PCI as part of an early invasive strategy, the use of a loading dose of clopidogrel of 600 mg, followed by a higher maintenance dose of 150 mg daily for 6 days, then 75 mg daily may be reasonable in patients not considered at high risk for bleeding. (Level of Evidence: B) Class III No Benefit 1. Abciximab should not be administered to patients in whom PCI is not planned. (Level of Evidence: A) 2. In UA / NSTEMI patients who are at low risk for ischemic events (e.g., TIMI risk score \u22652) or at high risk of bleeding and who are already receiving ASA and clopidogrel, upstream GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are not recommended. (Level of Evidence: B) Harm 1. In UA / NSTEMI patients with a prior history of stroke and/or TIA for whom PCI is planned, prasugrel is potentially harmful as part of a dual-antiplatelet therapy regimen.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat are the layers of skin and how do they function?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Skin is composed of three primary layers: the epidermis, which provides waterproofing and serves as a barrier to infection; the dermis, which serves as a location for the appendages of skin; and the hypodermis (subcutaneous adipose layer), which is called the basement membrane.\nEpidermis, \"epi\" coming from the Greek meaning \"over\" or \"upon\", is the outermost layer of the skin. It forms the waterproof, protective wrap over the body's surface and is made up of stratified squamous epithelium with an underlying basal lamina.\nThe outermost epidermis consists of stratified squamous epithelium with an underlying connective tissue section, or dermis, and a hypodermis, or basement membrane. The epidermis contains no blood vessels, and cells in the deepest layers are nourished by diffusion from blood capillaries extending to the upper layers of the dermis. The main type of cells which make up the epidermis are keratinocytes, with melanocytes and Langerhans cells also present. The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata (beginning with the outermost layer): corneum, lucidum (only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet), granulosum, spinosum, basale. Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer. The daughter cells, (see cell division) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source. The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted. They eventually reach the corneum and slough off (desquamation). This process is called keratinization and takes place within about 30 days. This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and pathogens out, making skin a natural barrier to infection.\nThe epidermis contains no blood vessels, and is nourished by diffusion from the dermis. The main type of cells which make up the epidermis are keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells and Merkels cells.\nEpidermis is divided into several layers where cells are formed through mitosis at the innermost layers. They move up the strata changing shape and composition as they differentiate and become filled with keratin. They eventually reach the top layer called stratum corneum and become sloughed off, or desquamated. This process is called keratinization and takes place within weeks. The outermost layer of Epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells.\nEpidermis is divided into the following 5 sublayers or strata:\nStratum corneum Stratum lucidum Stratum granulosum Stratum spinosum Stratum germinativum (also called \"stratum basale\")\nMnemonics that are good for remembering the layers of the skin (using \"stratum basale\" instead of \"stratum germinativum\"):\n\" C her L ikes G etting S kin B otoxed\" (from superficial to deep) \" B efore s igning, g et l egal c ounsel\" (from deep to superficial) \" B efore S ex G et L atex C ondoms (from deep to superficial)\nBlood capillaries are found beneath the epidermis, and are linked to an arteriole and a venule. Arterial shunt vessels may bypass the network in ears, the nose and fingertips.\nTemplate:Infobox Anatomy\nThe dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that consists of connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane. It also harbors many nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. The blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste removal to its own cells as well as the Stratum basale of the epidermis.\nStructure\nThe dermis is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the papillary region, and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region.\nThe papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue. It is named for its fingerlike projections called papillae, that extend toward the epidermis. The papillae provide the dermis with a \"bumpy\" surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin.\nIn the palms, fingers, soles, and toes, the influence of the papillae projecting into the epidermis forms contours in the skin's surface. These are called friction ridges, because they help the hand or foot to grasp by increasing friction. Friction ridges occur in patterns (see: fingerprint) that are genetically determined and are therefore unique to the individual, making it possible to use fingerprints or footprints as a means of identification.\nThe reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue, and receives its name from the dense concentration of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity.\nAlso located within the reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, receptors, nails, and blood vessels.\nTattoo ink is injected into the dermis. Stretch marks from pregnancy are also located in the dermis.\nThe hypodermis is not part of the skin, and lies below the dermis. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue and elastin. The main cell types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes (the hypodermis contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.\nMicroorganisms like Staphylococcus epidermidis colonize the skin surface. These microorganisms serve as ecoorgan. The density of skin flora depends on region of the skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from bacteria residing in the deeper areas of the hair follicle, gut and urogenital openings."}

I'll try to explain and give you my opinion. You should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg. A person might have high value during emotional and physicals trees so It's mandatory to judge on mean values. Hypertension is divided into two groups. Essential hypertension, usually in older age without an identified cause. It is a chronic disease, and should be treated all live long. Secondary hypertension is common in younger ages, meaning that it's a secondary house of it. This might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem or a cardiovascular anomaly. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze, your urinary catecholamine and a holder pressure monitoring. After all this we can better judge your mean values during day and night, we can understand if we have to do with hypertension and how to treat it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor. "}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the pathophysiology behind constrictive pericarditis?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The pathophysiology of constrictive pericarditis is   . The pericardium is composed of a double-layered sac that surrounds the heart and the roots of the great vessels. The serous layer (smooth visceral) and a fibrous layer (tough parietal) of the pericardium encloses the pericardial cavity which contains pericardial fluid.The pericardium function is to protect the heart against infection and to provide it with lubrication. The intrapericardial space contains 50 mL of plasma ultrafiltrate that minimize friction during cardiac motion.\nConstrictive pericarditis is a chronic inflammation that leads to the thickening, fibrosis, and scarring of the pericardial sac. The thickened fibrotic pericardium restricts the normal late diastolic filling in constrictive pericarditis and results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the ventricles \nChronic constrictive pericarditis characterized by obliteration of pericardial cavity by granulation tissue during healing of: \nAn acute episode of fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis A resorption of chronic pericardial effusion.\nThe heart becomes encased by the granulation tissue which gradually contracts may get calcified. The rigid thickened pericardium limits the normal elasticity of the pericardium and hence limits the ventricular filling. Ventricular filling in early diastole is not affected as it is impeded only when the pericardium elastic limit is reached.\nDuring inspiration, the negative pressure in the thoracic cavity will cause increased blood flow into the right ventricle (increased intrathoracic pressure). This increased volume in the right ventricle will cause the interventricular septum to bulge towards the left ventricle, leading to decreased filling of the left ventricle. Due to the Frank-Starling law, this will cause decreased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole. Because constrictive pericarditis limits the ability of the ventricles to expand, the intracardiac pressure variation during respiratory cycle occurs only between right and left ventricles.\nThe intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures dissociation leads to the following during inspiration:\nPulmonary venous pressure decreases Venous return decreases Left atrial pressure doesn't change Pulmonary veins to left atrial (LA) flow decreases\nDuring expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole.\nThis is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle.\nThe impairment of diastolic filling uniformly affects both ventricles, especially during the latter third of diastole. The symmetrical constricting effect of the pericardium results in elevation and equilibration of diastolic pressures in all four chambers of the heart. As a result of this constriction and elevated venous filling pressure, most diastolic filling occurs rapidly and early in diastole. This filling abruptly halts when the myocardium encounters the noncompliant pericardium.\nTriggers:\nThe following are pericarditis causes that can trigger the development of constrictive pericarditis:\nTuberculosis Viral infection Radiation therapy Trauma Post-cardiac surgery"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat does intraprocedural stent thrombosis mean?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "IPST can occur with bare metal stents and DES.  Several theories suggest possible explanation to IPST in DES. DES characteristics, such as drug-induced thrombogenicity, whether using sirolimus or paclitaxel, and its in-vitro platelet aggregation effects  along with its remarkable lipophilic bioavailability within the coronary milieu,  stent platform effect,  polymer coating material,  and open-cell stent design all seem plausible hypotheses that nonetheless require further validation. Operator-dependent factors, such as adequate stent placement have also been postulated.   AT-III is a naturally occurring thrombin inhibitor that suppresses tissue factor\u2013factor VIIa complex, factor IXa, Xa and thrombin. Its irreversible combination with thrombin inhibits the effect of thrombin on fibrinogen and clot formation . AT-III deficiency or decreased activity increase thrombin and fibrinogen activities, and thus clot formation. AT-III deficiency can be congenital or acquired. * The congenital form occurs in 1/3000 people, while the acquired form is seen in disseminated intravascular coagulation and nephrotic syndrome as a result of increased loss, or in malnutrition, liver cirrhosis or failure, as a result of decreased synthesis. Heparin therapy is the most common iatrogenic cause as it decreases AT-III half-life, while other causes include nitroglycerin and oral estrogen. Heparin binds to AT-III and enhances the rate of AT-III and thrombin reaction. This interaction activates AT-III to start an anticoagulation cascade that inactivates thrombin, factor Xa and other clotting factors. Heparin has no anticoagulant effect in AT-III depleted plasma. Heparin resistance is defined as the unexpected steady levels of activating clotting time while the patient is receiving adequate dose of heparin and having an adequate plasma concentration. In cardiothoracic surgery, heparin resistance is ACT of b400\u2013600 s after 300\u2013600 U/kg of UFH has been given. In patients with venous thromboembolism, HR is defined as needing N35,000 U of UFH in 24 h to achieve therapeutic levels. In interventional cardiology, an ACT of N250 s is needed to allow for a safe procedure. Heparin resistance can be AT-dependent or independent. In AT-dependent HR, the anticoagulant effect of heparin decreases when AT-III activity is b80%, and is completely ineffective at b70%. AT independent mechanisms include heparin induced thrombocytopenia due to neutralization of heparin effect from binding to platelet factor 4; and increased levels and enhanced activity of factor VIII and fibrinogen . In critically ill patients with coexisting severe inflammatory illnesses, where circulating acute phase reactants like platelet-derived factors, plasma proteins, and factor VIII levels are elevated, anti-Xa activity would be a more accurate measure of heparin activity. The reason is that these positively charged proteins readily bind to negatively charged heparin, thereby inhibiting and neutralizing its effect resulting in HR . Patients undergoing elective angiography and/or PCI are not usually screened for possible congenital or acquired deficiencies via natural anticoagulants prior to the procedure. Measuring anti-Xa activity instead of APTT or ACT is time consuming and not readily available in other facilities, especially in patients presenting with AMI, where door-to-balloon time is golden. Adventitial tissues and medial smooth muscle cells (SMC) are important sources of tissue factors that are responsible primarily for triggering the extrinsic clotting pathway. Thrombosis may occur when a large amount of tissue factor is released into the blood from the medial SMCs following medial tear secondary to excessive injury during stenting . Factors related to the procedures, including dissection of stent edge, remaining lesion stenosis, incomplete stent coverage, incomplete apposition, and incomplete expansion,can cause stent thrombosis ."}

Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more in your case, but better to first rule out heart diseases. You are already having hypertension and taking aspirin tablet, so we should first rule out cardiac diseases for your chest pain. So get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. So take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.

Is there a possibility it could also be cancerous or should it not be a concern?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Yes, cortical renal cyst can be a precancerous lesion for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). But it is not 100% true. If patient is smoker or having prolonged chemical exposure than chances are high. And detailed examination of cyst is needed to stamp it as pre malignant lesion. Like its border, shape, content, association with renal structures etc. all are important.  And most important is biopsy. At the time of pancreatitis your radiologist might miss these things. So renal cortical cyst can present as pre malignant lesion for RCC and can develop in RCC if risk factors are present like smoking."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the natural course, outlook, and possible complications of otitis externa?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Acute otitis externa usually develops up to 7 days after infection from the causative pathogen.  Initial symptoms include an odorless discharge from otorrhea, as well as mild otalgia and pruritus with signs of mild erythema of the ear canal. Without treatment, acute otitis externa will usually resolve without treatment within 4 days of onset.  Patients that are immunocompromised may experience a longer duration and escalation of symptoms, including edema, suppuration, and increased otalgia.  In more severe cases of acute otitis externa, additional symptoms may include parotitis, adenopathy, and auricular cellulitis. Otitis externa considered \"chronic\" - cases lasting more than 3 months with or without treatment - will usually persist indefinitely and will require treatment for resolution.  This is usually the case when it is caused by a form of dermatitis as a chronic reaction to recurrent exposure to cosmetological chemical irritants. Malignant necrotizing otitis externa usually develops when an infectiously-caused case of acute otitis externa spreads to the temporal bones, as well as bones in the ear adjacent to the canal, leading to damage and degradation.  Without treatment, malignant otitis externa will usually result in severe intra and extra cranial symptoms that include severe otalgia, difficulty swallowing, facial palsy, and cervicular lymphadenopathy, which will last indefinitely."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCould you explain the concept of the estrous cycle, please?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "One or several follicles of the ovary are starting to grow. Their number is specific for the species. Typically this phase can last as little as one day or as long as 3 weeks, depending on the species. Under the influence of estrogen the lining in the uterus (endometrium) starts to develop. Some animals may experience vaginal secretions that could be bloody. The female is not yet sexually receptive.\nEstrus refers to the phase when the female is sexually receptive (\" in heat,\" or \" on heat \" in British English). Under regulation by gonadotropic hormones, ovarian follicles are maturing and estrogen secretions exert their biggest influence. The animal exhibits a sexually receptive behavior, a situation that may be signaled by visible physiologic changes. A signal trait of estrus is the lordosis reflex, in which the animal spontaneously elevates her hindquarters. There is no consistent obvious signalling trait for human females.\nIn some species, the vulvae are reddened. Ovulation may occur spontaneously in some species (e.g. cow), while in others it is induced by copulation (e.g. cat). If there is no copulation in an induced ovulator, estrus may continue for many days, followed by' interestrus,' and the estrus phase starts again until copulation and ovulation occur.\nDuring this phase, the signs of estrogen stimulation subside and the corpus luteum starts to form. The uterine lining is under the influence of progesterone and becomes secretory. This phase typically is brief and may last 1 to 5 days. In some animals bleeding may be noted due to declining estrogen levels.\nDiestrus is characterised by the activity of the corpus luteum that produces progesterone. In the absence of pregnancy the diestrus phase (also termed pseudo-pregnancy) terminates with the regression of the corpus luteum. The lining in the uterus is not shed, but will be reorganised for the next cycle."}

After a delay, the stimulus is conducted through the bundle of His to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular epicardium.\nMicroscopically, the wave of depolarization propagates to adjacent cells via gap junctions located on the intercalated disk. The heart is a syncytium: electrical impulses propagate freely between cells in every direction, so that the myocardiam functions as a single contractile unit. This property allows rapid, synchronous depolarization of the myocardium. While normally advantageous, this property can be detrimental as it potentially allows the propagation of incorrect electrical signals.

Can understand your concern. As per your complaint a lump on the jaw can be due to a number of reasons and also depends upon the time duration for which they are present. A lump can be due to an infected tooth leading to pus formation near the root tips leading to formation of a lump (Dental abscess) as pus accumulates in the soft tissues. In this case treatment of the tooth either by root canal treatment or extraction can be done. It can also be due to a blocked salivary gland duct leading to back flow of saliva into the gland and appears as a swelling just below the jawline as well as in the floor of the mouth. It can also be due to inflamed lymph nodes due to infection in any part of the body and the lymph carries the infection along with it to the distant lymph nodes. It can also be cyst (jaw cyst, sebaceous cyst) or a tumor. In few long-standing cases it can be a cancerous lump too. I would suggest you to wait till the ultrasound report is given and need not to pain as the jaw lump can be most commonly due to non-cancerous causes and can be nothing serious. Treatment can be planned only after the diagnosis is confirmed. Hope your query is solved.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the explanation of the pathological mechanisms behind aortic regurgitation?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Acute aortic insufficiency is often secondary to infective endocarditis, aortic dissection,  or traumatic aortic rupture.  \nIn acute aortic insufficiency, the left ventricle becomes acutely volume overloaded by the retrograde flow of blood from the aorta. The left ventricle cannot dilate acutely to accommodate this large volume of regurgitant blood. As a result, the left ventricular end diastolic pressure rises abruptly and this rise in pressure is transmitted backward to the pulmonary circulation resulting in pulmonary edema. There is also a sudden decrease in forward cardiac output due to a reduction in stroke volume secondary to regurgitation of blood into left ventricle. The very high left ventricular end diastolic pressure causes reflex tachycardia as does the reduction in stroke volume. As a result of all of the above, hypotension and cardiogenic shock may ensue.\nInitially there may be a wide pulse pressure, but as the left ventricle fails, the pulse pressure may narrow as the left ventricular end diastolic pressure rises to equal the diastolic blood pressure, and the stroke volume of the left ventricle declines reducing the systolic blood pressure.  In some cases, the sharply rising left ventricular end diastolic pressure causes the mitral valve to close earlier during diastole. This early closure fortunately prevents backward flow of blood into the pulmonary vascular bed and often keeps the aortic diastolic pressure from falling too low and sometimes there may not be a wide pulse pressure.  \nChronic aortic insufficiency differs from the acute aortic insufficiency in so far as the left ventricle has time to adapt to the chronic volume overload through a series of compensatory changes, namely dilation and eccentric hypertrophy.   \nThe increasing regurgitant volume causes the stroke volume to fall. In order to compensate for a fraction of the blood going backwards, the heart compensates by ejecting a larger total volume of blood forward. The ejection fraction is preserved and perhaps even increased to compensate for the regurgitant fraction. In order to eject a larger volume of blood, the left ventricle must dilate. According to the Frank-Starling mechanism, left ventricular dilation up to a point is associated with greater contractility. The way the ventricle dilates is to lengthen the muscle fibers and the way it does this is to add sarcomeres in series. While the heart is normally shaped like a football, as it dilates, it begins to assume a more round, globular, and spherical shape. During this initial period, the left ventricle is fairly compliant. The patient is generally asymptomatic during this period.\nAs the heart dilates, there is a greater stress on the wall due to Laplace's Law. In order to compensate for the increased wall stress, eccentric hypertrophy develops.\nWhile the left ventricular dilation is associated with the increased cardiac output according to the Frank-Starling mechanism, at a certain point of left ventricular dilation, the left ventricle begins to fail as left ventricular contractility falls. Once wall thickening fails to keep up with the hemodynamic load, end systolic wall stress rises and at this point the left ventricle fails. The dramatic enlargement of the heart that is seen with aortic insufficiency is called cor bovinum. The left ventricle also stiffens over time due to increased interstitial fibrosis.  \nAt this point, the left ventricular ejection fraction falls. The left ventricular end systolic volume begins to rise. Next the left ventricular end diastolic volume begins to rise and this causes dyspnea or frank pulmonary edema. The first symptoms of the rise in left ventricular end diastolic pressure may be an increase in dyspnea on exertion.\nPatients with chronic aortic insufficiency may also develop myocardial ischemia. This is due to the fact that they have an increase in demand due to an increased thickness of the left ventricle and also a reduction in the supply due to a lower perfusion pressure during diastole.  \nIt has been said that' aortic regurgitation begets aortic regurgitation'. The high oscillatory shear associated with aortic regurgitation may lead to further dilation of the aorta, which in turn may lead to further worsening of aortic regurgitation.\nThe mitral valve ring may also dilate leading to mitral regurgitation which further can progress to the development of left atrium dilatation. Left atrial dilation may in turn cause atrial fibrillation which further reduces left ventricular filling."}

This test uses a stain which reacts to a particular type of leukemic cells. The stain causes the granules of most acute myeloid leukemia cells to appear as black spots under the microscope, but it does not cause acute lymphoblastic cells to change colors.\nIn these tests special antibodies are used to detect cancer cells and thus to differentiate acute myeloid leukemia from other leukemias. Monoclonal antibody binding to specific antigens, such as CD33 or CD117, are helpful in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. Sufficient sample must be present in order for these tests to be reliable.\nPolymerase chain reaction is a highly sensitive DNA test used to recognize cancer cells in acute myeloid leukemia, especially for detection of minimal residual disease testing or for molecular mutation assessment. Next-generation sequencing is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic test.\nBone marrow examination is often performed to identify the type of abnormal blood cells; however, if there are many leukemic cells circulating in the peripheral blood, a bone marrow biopsy may not be necessary. Bone marrow is examined via light microscopy as well as flow cytometry to diagnose acute myeloid leukemia, to differentiate acute myeloid leukemia from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and to classify the sub-type of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal translocations by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \nLumber puncture: Assessment of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be done via lumbar puncture. This diagnostic study is especially useful for patients with acute myeloid leukemia who have neurologic deficits, as this is concerning for central nervous system involvement. The cell count from the cerebrospinal fluid will show malignant myeloid cells (typically greater than 2 cells per microliter of cerebrospinal fluid). Treatment of cerebrospinal fluid involvement includes methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine."}

These abnormal amyloids are derived from misfolding and aggregation of normally soluble proteins. Amyloid deposition can disrupt tissue structure of involved organ and consequently leads to organ failure. \nIn systemic amyloidosis, amyloid gradually accumulates and amyloid deposition is widespread in the viscera, blood vessel walls, and different connective tissues.  \nWild-type (senile) amyloidosis is a type of systemic amyloidosis as transthyretin (TTR) deposits can be found throughout the body.  The culprit protein responsible for the disease is TTR and it is deposited in the non- mutated form, hence the name \"wild-type\". TTR results in pathologies due to misfolding, breaking apart, and deposition of the amyloid fibrils in healthy tissue. The normal TTR protein, compared with the mutated form, is less likely to get deposited and cause pathology. This is believed to be the reason as to why this condition almost always affects the elderly (65 years of age or older). The condition mainly affects the heart. However, other organ systems, such as the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, can also be involved."}

A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As the pathology of the knee joint is troubling you, and you also do not want to go for surgery I will advise to try physical therapy. As with physical therapy, your pain and inflammation will be reduced by use of therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. Also, since you have Grave IV Chen Chat Doctor.  If the ACL is completely torn then surgery will be advised as the life expectancy of the knee has to be kept into consideration. Also, once ACL reconstruction is done you can later proceed to physical therapy for strengthening exercises and ROM exercises which will help to extend the life of the knee joint. Due to ACL injury, the knee joint enters into faster degeneration, so ACL reconstruction will be advised in my opinion. As it is a small procedure and recovery is also optimum. Also, once ACL reconstruction is done, you may avoid the TKR in the future. To avoid TKR you need to understand that ACL reconstruction is important. Rest I leave a choice on you. In my clinical practice, I avoid surgery for my patient with grade I ACL injury but witChatDoctorplete tear I also advise surgery, post which the knee ROM and strengthening is performed, and optimum results are achieved with 100% of success.

However, the only definitive test for Loeffler endocarditis is cardiac muscle biopsy showing the presence of eosinophilic infiltrates.\nThe definite diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis is based on cardiac muscle biopsy, showing the presence of eosinophilic infiltrates and sometimes fibrosis. Since the disorder may be patchy, multiple tissue samples taken during the procedure improve the chances of uncovering the pathology but in any case negative results do not exclude the diagnosis.\nThe most common symptoms of Loeffler endocarditis include weight loss, fever, cough, a rash (possibly pruritic) and symptoms of congestive heart failure.\nCommon physical examination findings of Loeffler endocarditis include peripheral oedema, elevated jugular venous pressure, tachycardia, murmur of mitral regurgitation, S3 gallop and possibly S4 sound. (physical findings of heart failure)\nPalpable apex beat and mitral regurgitation help to differentiate restrictive cardiomyopathy may be very similar to those of constrictive pericarditis.\nHypereosinophilia (i.e. blood eosinophil counts at or above 1,500 per microliter) or, less commonly, eosinophilia (counts above 500 but below 1,500 per microliter) are found in the vast majority of cases and are valuable clues pointing to this rather than other types of cardiomyopathies. However, elevated blood eosinophil counts may not occur during the early phase of the disorder. Other, less specific laboratory findings implicate a cardiac disorder but not necessarily eosinophilic myocarditis. These include elevations in blood markers for systemic inflammation (e.g. C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and cardiac injury (e.g. c reatine kinase, troponin s); Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis include marked eosinophilia - at least 0.44 x 109/l.\nAn ECG may be helpful in the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis. Findings on an ECG suggestive of/diagnostic of Loeffler endocarditis include ST segment -T wave abnormalities, and sometimes evidences of atrial enlargement.\nAn x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis. Findings on an x-ray suggestive of Loeffler endocarditis include cardiomegaly and presentation of heart failure and pulmonary edema. Nevertheless, these findings are neither specific nor sensitive for the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis.\nEchocardiography may be helpful in the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis. Findings on an echocardiography suggestive of/diagnostic of Loeffler endocarditis include restrictive filling but pretty good left ventricular systolic function. Echocardiography typically gives non-specific and only occasional findings of endocardium thickening, left ventricul ar hypertrophy, left ventricle dilation, and involvement of the mitral and/or tricuspid valve s. Three\u2010dimensional transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography might provide additional information to conventional two\u2010dimensional transthoracic echocardiography alone in patients with Loeffler endocarditis. \nImproved detection is imparted by the use of a multi-modality investigation, including the use of transesophageal echocardiography and contrast agents.\nA standard transthoracic echocardiogram will typically reveal the following features, which are characteristic of the restrictive cardiomyopathies:\nNormal left ventricular systolic function Normal LV cavity dimensions Diastolic dysfunction Majority of cases advanced dysfunction, typically grade III, formerly known as the \"restrictive filling\" profile Early, incidentally detected cases may have lesser degrees of dysfunction Pulsed wave doppler (mitral inflow) and tissue doppler (mitral annuli) demonstrate: An E/A ratio > 2 A deceleration time (DT) < 160 ms A septal e' < 8 cm/s An LVEDP (septal E/e') > 15\nFeatures which are specific to the hypereosinophilic syndrome include:\nLeft ventricular apical obliteration by laminar thrombosis Diffuse and echogenic thrombus Occurs in the absence of regional wall motion abnormalities The key distinction from the far more common apical thrombosis due to e.g. ischemic heart disease and subsequent apical dyskinesis Thickening and increased echogenicity of subendocardial structures Preferential involvement of the left ventricular posterobasal (inferolateral) wall and posterior leaflet of mitral valve Consequent restricted excursion of mitral valve's posterior leaflet Eccentric mitral regurgitation\nAlthough multimodality imaging is recommended in diagnosis and management of Loeffler endocarditis, but CT scan is barely used a an imaging modality. \nMRI and echocardiography were used extensively in diagnosis and management of these cases.\nCardiac MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis.  Gadolinium -based cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful non-invasive procedure for diagnosing eosinophilic myocarditis. Findings on MRI suggestive of/diagnostic of Loeffler endocarditis include at least two of the following abnormalities: An increased signal in T2-weighted images; An increased global myocardial early enhancement ratio between a myocardial and skeletal muscle in enhanced T1 images and One or more focal enhancements distributed in a non-vascular pattern in late enhanced T1-weighted image s. Additionally, and unlike in other forms of myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis may also show enhanced gadolinium uptake in the sub-endocardium. Multiparametric cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) \nMultiparametric CMR can not only diagnose Loeffler endocarditis but also reveal the patchy disease state. which could be helpful in prognosis assessment. Furthermore, Multiparametric CMR can also be used for treatment monitoring. and follow up. Compared to echocardiography, cardiac MRI allows multiple scanning planes with excellent spatial resolution and the possibility of tissue characterization.\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with Loeffler endocarditis.\nThere are no other diagnostic studies associated with Loeffler endocarditis."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the pathophysiology behind hypoaldosteronism?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The juxtaglomerular apparatus of the macula densa primarily senses the concentration of plasma sodium and renal perfusion pressure.   In response to low plasma sodium concentration or decreased renal perfusion pressure, the juxtaglomerular apparatus secretes renin. On secretion, renin cleaves angiotensinogen (produced by liver) to angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme produced in the lungs further cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The main site of activity for angiotensin II is zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex, where angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone synthase which converts deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone.\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is a tightly controlled feedback mechanism which regulates sodium and blood pressure in our body.  Low plasma sodium, decreased perfusion pressure and hyperkalemia stimulates aldosterone secretion. Hypokalemia suppresses aldosterone secretion.\nAldosterone is synthesized at a rate of approximately 100 to 150 ug/day.\n\n\nHypoaldosteronism is defined as decreased levels of the hormone aldosterone or a resistance of the target tissue to the actions of aldosterone. Hypoaldosteronism can be due to:  Aldosterone deficiency: The deficiency in aldosterone can be due to congenital isolated hypoaldosteronism, primary adrenal insufficiency, diabetic nephropathy, critical illness, and drugs such as ACE inhibitors, NSAID and calcineurin inhibitors. Aldosterone resistance: In aldosterone resistance, the level of aldosterone is normal but there is decreased response of the target tissue to the actions of aldosterone. Aldosterone resistance is seen with mineralocorticoid receptor defects (seen in pseudohypoaldosteronism) and with drugs such as potassium-sparing diuretics and trimethoprim.\nHypoaldosteronism results in reduced reabsorption of sodium in the principal cells of cortical collecting tubules (CCT). This leads to decreased excretion of potassium and mild non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.\nHyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is most commonly seen in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy:    In patients of renal insufficiency, atrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) leads to decreased sensing of plasma sodium concentration and renal perfusion pressure. With progression of the renal disease and atrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) there may be inadequate renin production and release. A decrease in renin production and release leads to decreased angiotensin production, which eventually causes hypoaldosteronism. Renal insufficiency may also cause decreased response of the principal cells in the cortical collecting tubule to aldosterone.\nHyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism also known as secondary isolated hypoaldosteronism is seen in patients with severe illness such as sepsis, malignancy, heart failure, adrenal dysfunction and liver cirrhosis.    During these stress inducing conditions, increased levels of ACTH and cortisol are seen. Under normal conditions, continuous ACTH secretion for greater than 96 hours leads to suppression of aldosterone synthase activity. Chronically ill patients with prolonged ACTH secretion (>96 hours) have impaired aldosterone synthase activity and decreased levels of aldosterone. In response, the kidneys via its neurohormonal regulation leads to increased levels of renin and hence the term hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism. In addition, cytokine release from chronic illness or increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (in patients with heart failure) also have an inhibitory effect on the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex. Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism is also seen in patients with adrenal dysfunction such as Addison's disease. Primary adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease can be due to adrenal dysgenesis, impaired steroidogenesis, and adrenal destruction. In patients of primary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands does not produce sufficient cortisol and aldosterone. The decrease in level of aldosterone leads to decreased absorption of sodium in the kidneys and increased retention of potassium. This in turn activates the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) of the kidneys, which secretes renin in an attempt to normalise plasma sodium concentration and perfusion pressure. However, due to adrenal dysfunction the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex is unable to produce aldosterone and presents with hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism.\nIn isolated hypoaldosteronism, there is selective deficiency of aldosterone with normal cortisol production. Isolated hypoaldosteronism may result from dysfunction of zona glomerulosa or aldosterone synthase deficiency.  Aldosterone synthase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of aldosterone. Patients with aldosterone synthase enzyme deficiency (type I and type II) results in defective conversion of deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone and subsequently abnormal levels of aldosterone. Certain drugs such as heparin and nitric oxide have a direct suppressive effect on the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex which may lead to decrease production of aldosterone.\nPostadrenalectomy hypoaldosteronism is seen in patients with Conn syndrome who undergo surgery for tumor removal:       \nConn syndrome is most often unilateral and leads to excessive production of aldosterone from the affected adrenal gland. Excessive production of aldosterone causes hypertension and suppression of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). Patients with Conn syndrome who are treated with spironolactone and later undergo surgery for tumor removal may develop hypoaldosteronism. Patients with Conn syndrome have increased levels of aldosterone and decreased plasma renin activity (from suppressed RAAS) which leads to chronic suppression of contralateral zona glomerulosa. On surgical removal of aldosterone producing tumor, there is sudden decline in circulating aldosterone which leads to hypoaldosteronism.\nMineralocorticoid resistance is characterized by a decrease in response to the hormone aldosterone. In mineralocorticoid resistance the level of aldosterone may be normal or supranormal. It is due to this reason mineralocorticoid resistance is also known as pseudohypoaldosteronism. Mineralocorticoid resistance can be further categorized into:   \nPseudohypoaldosteronism Type I: The decrease in response to aldosterone is due to heterozygous or homozygous inactivating mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor. These patients are also resistant to mineralocorticoid therapy. Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type II: This is an extremely rare disorder. It is speculated that these patients have mutations in the genes encoding proteins of the serine threonine kinase family (WKNK1 or WNK4 kinases). Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type II is characterized by low or low-normal plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations, leading to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis with normal renal function. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II is also known as Gordon\u2019s syndrome. Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type III: This condition presents with transient mineralocorticoid resistance. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type III is seen in patients with underlying renal conditions with decreased glomerular filtration rate. The exact cause is unknown but is thought to be related to increased levels of TGF -\u03b2."}

The numbness in the lip can be because of the pressure over the nerve by an impacted wisdom tooth, or it can be because of the nerve injury by any trauma. If I am your treating doctor, I would have suggested you to get a radiograph like OPG to rule out both the problems.Meanwhile, I would have suggested you to take course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500\u00a0mg and metronidazole 400\u00a0mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic) for the tooth infection.

It is important to know at what stage cancer cervix was detected in your mother and what treatment she is taking for it. Cancer cervix is a disease that occurs due to uncontrolled proliferation of cells in the cervix of uterus. It is important to know if she has early stage cancer or a later stage. Treatment differs as surgery is best for complete treatment at early stages and chemotherapy and radiation therapy can prolong survival in those with late stage disease. Vomiting and weakness can be treated with maintaining a proper diet and also correcting any deficiencies like anemia. During treatment, patients are known to have anemia and reactions to medicines. This needs to be carefully evaluated and if required regular anti vomiting medicines need to be taken. Please take measures to improve her diet and give her small frequent meals of her choice. Scattered rales in lungs need to be evaluated by doing a chest X-ray. If the lungs are clear then no treatment required for it. Please do not worry."}

I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to a metabolic disorder (chronic anemia, thyroid dysfunction, etc.) or low blood pressure. Have you checked your blood pressure values lately? Regarding the pulsations in the belly region they are related to an abdominal aorta. They can be felt normally in elegant persons. But they can be more prominent during chronic anemia or thyroid dysfunction. From the other hand an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta can not be excluded either. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a chest X-ray study- a resting ECG- an abdominal ultrasound-complete blood count for anemia-thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Wishing good health, "}

Upper GI bleed (due to esophageal mucosal damage as observed on endoscopy) has been reported among 4% of patients with other GI symptoms such as abdominal pain related to novel coronavirus infection. It is not known whether bleeding is a complication of other entities or a separate phenomenon in COVID-19 infection but has been mentioned together with abdominal pain. The esophagus, stomach, duodenum and stool have been tested positive for viral RNA.

Adenocarcinoma of the lung may be classified according to WHO into 8 subtypes: Lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, solid, colloid, fetal, enteric adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma of the lung may be classified according to IASLC/ATS/ERS into 3 main types: adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, invasive adenocarcinoma. On gross pathology, peripheral multifocal lesions is the characteristic finding of adenocarcinoma of the lung. On microscopic histopathological analysis, nuclear atypia, eccentrically placed nuclei, abundant cytoplasm, and conspicuous nucleoli are characteristic findings of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Genes involved in the pathogenesis of adenocarcinoma of the lung include EGFR, HER2, KRAS, ALK, and BRAF. Common risk factors in the development of adenocarcinoma of the lung include smoking, family history of lung cancer, high levels of air pollution, radiation therapy to the chest, radon gas, asbestos, occupational exposure to chemical carcinogens, and previous lung disease. The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the lung is approximately 22.1 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. Adenocarcinoma of the lung affects men and women equally. Patients of all age groups may develop adenocarcinoma of the lung. Common symptoms of adenocarcinoma of the lung include dyspnea, hemoptysis, chronic coughing, chest pain, cachexia, dysphonia, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Adenocarcinoma of the lung may be classified into several subtypes based on TNM and UICC staging system. The predominant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the lung is surgical resection. Adjunctive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and target therapy may be required. Common complications of adenocarcinoma of the lung include breathing difficulties, pneumonia, pleural effusion, metastasis, and Horner's syndrome. The prognosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung varies with the staging of tumor; Stage IA have the most favorable prognosis. The presence of metastasis is associated with a particularly poor prognosis."}

I suggest you not to worry much. Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity that can affect a persons thoughts, behavior, feelings and sense of well-being.

This is what you should know. Depression need not be treated with medicines, in the first hand. It requires lifestyle changes so that the mind acquires the capacity of coming out of the current negative feelings. These things are practiced in psychotherapy.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the meaning of reperfusion injury?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Reperfusion injury, also known as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) or re-oxygenation injury, is the tissue damage which results from the restoration of blood supply to the tissue after a period of ischemia, anoxia or hypoxia from different pathologies. During the period of absence of blood to the tissues a condition is created in which the resulting reperfusion will result in inflammation and oxidative damage through the involvement of various mechanisms mainly involving oxidation, free radical formation and complement activation which ultimately leads to cell death, rather than restoration of normal function. Various intracellular or extracellular changes during ischemia leads to increased intracellular calcium and ATP depletion that will ultimately land up in the cell death if the ongoing process does not stopped. Reperfusion forms reactive oxygen species. This leads to Increased mitochondrial pore permeability, complement activation & cytochrome release, inflammation and edema formation, Neutrophil platelet adhesion and thrombosis leading to progressive tissue death. In Heart reperfusion injury is attributed to oxidative stress which in turn leads to arrhythmias, Infarction and Myocardial stunning. In case of trauma the resulting restoration of blood flow to the tissue after prolonged ischemia aggravates tissue damage by either directly causing additional injury or by unmasking the injury sustained during the ischemic period. Reperfusion injury can occur in any organ of body mainly seen in the heart, intestine, kidney, lung, and muscle, and is due to microvascular damage."}

You are on both brief and pant. You did finger your girlfriend without touching to penis. If you have touched penis then also extremely fewer sperm can attach\u00e9 to finger.

It would be greatly appreciated!\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello Jenny ! The age group of your grandmother demands prompt and detailed investigations on her swollen belly. You have not mentioned whether she is ambulatory or bedridden post stroke. In bedridden patients, we have to exclude fecal impaction, which may give rise to abdominal swelling. Wheezing is due to her respiratory infection/allergy which needs to be taken care of by a medicine specialist. Apart from this, you have to think of a chronic urinary tract infection in non-ambulatory patients, which has to be taken care of. If the above are excluded, then consult a medical specialist, who may advise her for a complete evaluation of her kidney function, liver function and cardio vascular status all of which may give rise to swollen belly and the last one can give rise to weeping as well. She may also need an ultrasound abdomen to exclude accumulation of fluid in the belly/or any space occupying lesion. So, without any delay take her to a specialist clinic for clinical evaluation and treatment. We all wish her an early recovery."}

Do net plan pregnancy till your prolactin levels decrease to less than 30 and your symptoms are under control. I know you must be very anxious to conceive but if you conceive before the prolactin levels are normal it can create problems during pregnancy. Repeat prolactin in 3 months to know the response.

First, baseline weights must be established and correlated to serum sodium levels. Weight will normally fluctuate during the day, but as the water intake of the polydipsic goes up, the weight will naturally rise. The physician can order a stepped series of interventions as the weight rises. The correlation must be individualized with attention paid to the patient's normal weight and fluctuations, diet, co-morbid disorders (such as a seizure disorder) and urinary system functioning. Progressive steps might include redirection, room restriction, and increasing levels of physical restraint with monitoring. Such plans should also progressive increases in monitoring, as well as a level at which a serum sodium level is drawn.\nIt is important to note that the majority of psychotropic drugs (as well as many of other classes) can cause dry mouth, but this is not to be confused with true polydipsia in which a dangerous drop in serum sodium will be seen.\nWhile psychogenic polydipsia is generally not found outside the population of those with serious mental disorders, there is some anecdotal evidence of a milder form (typically called'habit polydispsia' or'habit drinking') that can occasionally be found in the absence of psychosis or other mental conditions. The excessive levels of fluid intake may result in a false diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, since the chronic ingestion of excessive water can produce diagnostic results that closely mimic those of mild diabetes insipidus."}

Also, it is possible for fluid to build up in the lungs of the patients which makes it difficult for the lungs to fully expand when inhaling.\nPneumonia\nIf the cancer grows in the airway, it may obstruct airflow, causing breathing difficulties. This can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, predisposing the patient to pneumonia.\nHemoptysis (coughing up blood)\nOccasionally lung cancer can cause bleeding in the airways which results in the patient coughing up blood.\nPain\nIt is possible that lung cancer will cause pain as well, especially if it spreads to the lining of the lung, or other areas of the body, like the bones. There are treatments to help combat the pain.\nPleural effusion\nLung cancer can cause fluid to build up in the lungs which can cause breathing difficulties. There are treatments available to help drain the excess fluid\nMetastasis\nIn many cases, lung cancer will spread out to other parts of the body. Some of the more common places lung cancer metastasizes to are the bones, liver, brain, and adrenal glands.\nHorner's syndrome\nTumors in the top (apex) of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to changed sweating patterns and eye muscle problems (a combination known as Horner's syndrome).\nSuperior vena cava syndrome SVCS is a group of symptoms caused by obstruction of the superior vena cava. More than 60% of cases of superior vena cava obstruction are caused by malignant causes, typically a tumor outside the vessel compressing the vessel wall.\nSurgical Complications\nBronchopleural fistula\nIt is when air leaks from a pneumonectomy bronchial stump Approximately 2% of patients that undergo a pneumonectomy experience this It will most commonly occur approximately 7 to 10 days after surgery\nHemothorax\nIn most cases it occurs from bronchial vessels or lung parenchyma It may have the symptoms of hypovolemia Usually, it can be treated by transfusion\nAtelectasis Sputum retention"}

Smoking also cause HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). And HERD can cause chest tightness and burning chest pain. It also causes worsening of asthma. So your symptoms are mostly due to smoking induced HERD. So quit smoking as soon as possible. Get done chest x-ray to rule out lung cancer. Possibility of lung cancer is less in your case. Better control of HERD is needed for symptomatic relief. You need following lifestyle modifications. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start Proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux.

If the injury over your lip and gum is not very severe then don't worry, as it would surely heal...only if the injury is deep enough you need to get it sutured otherwise it would lead to a bad scar (over your lip). Teeth that are injured have to be examined periodically... These traumatized teeth become non-vital and get discolored developing into small cyst at the bottom of the tooth later on....if the tooth is slightly mobile (which you would not be knowing) splinting needs to be carried out to prevent tooth from getting more mobile. The ideal time for splinting is within 12 hours of injury. As it gets delayed the prognosis worsens. The horizontal lines must be the cracks over the tooth surface as a result of trauma...get yourself examined from your dental surgeon for further clinical evaluation and management."}

Thank you for your query. I am very proud of your lifestyle and dedication to maintain good health. Gout is a common condition that takes place due to high serum uric acid levels. I would first like to inform you that serum uric acid levels can be controlled to quite an extent through diet. Why don't you consult a nutritionist for the same. If you succeed, then we can wean you off the medication. Allopurinol has shown to cause a rise in bilirubin levels, which is why you notice only the rise of bilirubin levels. As long as other parameters to measure your liver function are within normal limits, there should be absolutely no reason to be worried. Try controlling your gout through your diet, which will help your doctor in reducing the dose and gradually weaning you off the allopurinol. Wishing you loads of luck.

Quick treatment not only improves your chances of survival, but may also reduce the amount of complications resulting from the stroke.\nMedications: Medications, such as aspirin, warfarin or heparin, may be proven immediate treatment after a stroke to reduce the likelihood of having another stroke. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is a potent clot-busting drug that helps some people who have had stroke recover more fully. These drugs are forbidden to people who are having a hemorrhagic stroke. Surgery: Surgical procedure including carotid endarterectomy, angioplasty and stents, can be used to open up an artery that's moderately to severely narrowed by plaques.\nCarotid endarterectomy: In this procedure, a surgeon opens the blocked artery and removes plaques that block the carotid arteries that run up both sides of your neck to your brain. The procedure may reduce your risk of ischemic stroke. Angioplasty and stents: In this procedure, the doctor put a balloon-tipped catheter into the obstructed area of your artery. When the balloon is inflated, compressing the plaques against your artery walls. Then the stent is usually left in the artery to prevent recurrent narrowing.\nMost hemorrhagic stroke is associated with aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Surgery may be recommended to treat these disorders or prevent another one. The most common procedures include aneurysm clipping, aneurysm embolization and arteriovenous malformation removal.\nAneurysm clipping Coiling (aneurysm embolization) Surgical arteriovenous malformation (AVM) removal\nThe physiatrist will help you recover the skills you may have lost, such as walking, communicating, or keeping balance or coordination.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat are the methods for preventing dementia?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "\"Use it or Lose it\" might be applied to the brain when it comes to dementia. Intellectual activities help keep the mind in shape in the older days. Activities, such as reading, playing cards and board games and playing a musical instrument prevents dementia of both Alzheimer's and vascular dementia . The risk decreases proportionally to the frequency of activity. \nNot only activities during spare time seem to prevent dementia. What kind of occupation also matters, especially during the thirties, forties and fifties . A good job in this case is any mentally demanding one.\nWhy activity contributes to prevent dementia could be explained by a \"brain reserve\" built up by the brain; Additional connections between neurons are created, connections more resistant to the deterioration seen in dementia .\nSince vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia (after Alzheimer's disease), decreasing risk factors for Cerebrovascular disease also decreases the risk factors for dementia. Thus, physical exercise, having good blood cholesterol, healthy Body weight and Blood pressure lowers the risk of developing dementia . An active lifestyle can almost halve the risk compared to a sedentary one .\nThe effect of physical activity isn't limited to vascular effects. For instance, it can give rise to new neurons in the brain, as well as releasing a substance that can protect them .\nFurthermore, physical activity has many other Exercise benefits.\nObesity increases the risk of any dementia, but Alzheimer's in particular .\nHowever, what kind of food eaten also matters. Fish consumtion reduces the risk of Alzheimer's . Fish is high in Docosahexaenoic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid, especially in cold water fish such as salmon, tuna and halibut.\nVegetables and nuts also benefit , because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats. Non-fish meat, on the other hand, increases the risk of Alzhemer's , by its high content of Saturated fat. The moderate consumption of alcohol may reduce risk through improving vascular health and other mechanisms. \nHowever, there is no certain effect of eating antioxidants , such as beta carotene, Vitamin C or Vitamin D Antioxidants lowers the level of free radicals, and theoretically this could lower the risk of dementia by deceasing the damage on neurons caused by the free radicals.\nIron deficiency is another risk factor for dementia . A deficiency leads to insufficient amounts in the brain cells of heme, a molecule with iron as one of the components. In an attempt to compensate, the brain cells produce excess amounts of the other components. These components react with oxygen, creating free radicals which damage the neurons of the brain."}

Julie Mills\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello, Probably the nerves supplying your lower feet are getting compressed in the spinal cord in the region of fluid collection. That is why you are getting the pins and needle sensation. One of the options for the treatment is surgical decompression of that region so that fluid is removed and it no longer presses and irritates the nerves. Some medications are also available which reduce such kind of tingling, but they won't tackle the primary problem i.e. fluid collection. You should see a neurosurgeon/ spine surgeon, and he will guide you about further treatment. Good luck."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is LQT2 and its subtype, and how do they differ from each other?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "This form of long QT syndrome most likely involves mutations of the human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) on chromosome 7. The HERG gene (also known as KCNH2) is part of the rapid component of the potassium rectifying current (I Kr). (The I Kr current is mainly responsible for the termination of the cardiac action potential, and therefore the length of the QT interval.) The normally functioning HERG gene allows protection against early after depolarizations (EADs).\nThere is a possibility, that like in LQT1 mutations, the location of the mutation may have a differing impact on the individual who is affected. A study of 201 patients showed that persons with mutations in the pore region had a greater risk of cardiac events and sudden cardiac death, and that these manifestations occurred earlier than in persons with mutations in the non-pore regions .\nSeizures - due to oxygen deprivation that occurs during arrhythmia. Fainting - fainting or syncope is the most common symptom LQTS. A prodrome may occur before losing consciousness, which may consist of lightheadedness, heart palpitations, blurred vision or weakness. Sudden death - a fatal arrhythmia that is not quickly intervened on, may cause sudden death. In LQT2, syncope, prodrome, or other events may particularly occur in the post-partum period, or in response to auditory stimuli. Undiagnosed LQT2 may be present in certain individuals who develop acquired long QT syndrome in response to certain medications.\nBeta-blockers are the first line treatment in LQTS, even in asymptomatic carriers, as they reduce the incidence of syncope and sudden cardiac death. Other medications to control non-malignant arrhythmias. Electrolytes should be repleted as neccesary. Avoidance of triggers (drugs, supplements, loud noises, exercise). LQTs is one of the few diseases where genetic testing can provide important guidance, such as in whom to place an AICD (defibrillator) for the primary prevention of cardiac events.  Placement of a pacemaker may be indicated. Left stellectomy is not a cure, but is a second line therapy to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death and is indicated if the patient does not tolerate beta blockers, as well as in young patients under the age of 12 where beta blockers are not deemed protective enough and AICD is not appropriate. Patients with long QT syndrome should undergo secondary prevention with AICD implantation if they sustain an aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death."}

A reduced release of endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF) causes a decrease in the stimulation of guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels fall in vascular smooth muscle. This impairs relaxation in the vasculature and is a part of the vicious cycle of CHF.  Patients with CHF have a down-regulation of their \u03b2-1 adrenergic receptors which alters their ability to activate intracellular adenylate cyclase which catalyzes cAMP formation.  cAMP is the second messenger that controls the level of calcium available to allow the heart to contract. An IV administration of amrinone has been shown to increase cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) while concurrently reducing the filling pressure of the left ventricle and decreasing the resistance in the peripheral vasculature.    This does not lead to an increase in heart rate or blood pressure.    This improvement in performance of the ventricles is likely to result from a direct stimulation of the depressed myocardium as well as a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance."}

The association was further clarified in 2005 after the discovery of loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 in patients with low LDL-C. This loss-of-function was linked to a 40% reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C in the studied population.  PCSK9 has a major role in the metabolism of hepatic cholesterol. It is a serine protease that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), inducing LDLR degradation in the lysosomes. Reduced LDL receptor levels result in decreased metabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL), which could lead to hypercholesterolemia.  The sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), which is activated in the presence of low intracellular levels of cholesterol, also induces the expression of PCSK9, thereby increasing the amount of circulating LDL-cholesterol.  Several drugs have been investigated for the inhibition of PCSK9, and have demonstrated a more potent lowering of LDL cholesterol levels than the current available drugs. Phase II and phase III trials have demonstrated good tolerability and efficacy in lowering LDL choleterol, with exploratory analyses demonstrating a reduction in cardiovascular events . Although it is biologically plausible that this reduction in LDL would also lead to a reduction in atherothrombotic events, additional clinical trials are ongoing to determine the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in improving CV outcomes.    \nPCSK9 Function Pharmacologic Interventions for PCSK9 inhibition\nFor more information regarding this approach to lipid management, click here. For details about specific agents, click on the following links: Alirocumab, Evolocumab, Bococizumab\nMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein is an endosomal protein found in the hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes. It catalyses the transfer of cholesterol esters and triglycerides to nascent apo B, leading to the formation of chylomicron and VLDL in the intestine and hepatocyte, respectively.  Chylomicrons and other apo-B48-containing remnant lipoproteins are essential for intestinal fat absorption and its transfer to peripheral tissues. Mutations of the MTTP gene leads to a condition known as abetalipoproteinemia, which causes an absence of apo-B-containing lipoproteins and very low levels of LDL-C and triglycerides.   Individuals with this recessive condition have severe intestinal malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) manifesting as fatty liver, night-blindness, rickets or osteomalacia, neuropathy, ataxia, and coagulopathy.\nSeveral MTP inhibitors are being investigated:\nNon-intestinal-specific agents Lomitapide (AEGR-427, previously known as BMS-201038 - Bristol-Myers-Squibb) by Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Implitapide (formerly AEGR-427 or Bayer BAY-13-9952) CP-34086 by Pfizer Intestinal-specific agents Dirlotapide by Pfizer JTT-130 and SLx-4090 by Surface Logix.\nEarly clinical trials that enrolled patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia demonstrated up to 50% reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C and apo B with MTP inhibition.  However, higher doses were associated with transient elevations in liver transaminases and hepatic fat accumulation. Further developments of CP-34086 and implitapide have been placed on hold due to their hepatic adverse effects. Intestinal-specific agents such as dirlotapide, JTT-130, and SLx-4090 were developed to prevent the hepatic effects of the non-specific agents. Thus far, these agents are still early in human clinical trials (except dirlotapide), but several reports have demonstrated significant reductions in postprandial triglyceridemia and total cholesterol in preclinical studies.  Intestinal-specific MTP inhibitors may be effective in treating hyperchylomicronemia but their efficacy as LDL-C lowering agents is uncertain.\nApolipoprotein B (apo B) is a large protein that is present in all atherogenic lipoproteins i.e., VLDL, LDL, IDL. There is a single copy of apo B-100 in all these lipoproteins, therefore, plasma levels of apo B-100 are proportionate to the concentration of circulating atherogenic lipoproteins and are associated with a higher cardiovascular risk.  Apo B exists in two main isoforms, apo B100 and apo B48. The liver synthesizes apo B-100, whereas the small intestine synthesizes apo B48. Apo B100 serves two main functions - (1) it provides structural stability to the circulating lipoproteins, and (2) it acts as a ligand for LDL receptors (LDLR). On the other hand, apo B48 is a unique structural protein of chylomicrons that originate from the small intestine. The removal of LDL particles from the plasma involves the binding of apo B to LDLR, then, the resulting apo B-100-LDLR complex gets internalized into the hepatocyte for processing.  Mutations that lower the affinity of apo B-100 for LDLR result in decreased clearance of LDLs, a condition known as familial defective apo B, which is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.  In contrast, mutations in apo B that decrease its translation or secretion have been demonstrated to reduce circulating LDL-C and improve cardiovascular risk.  All of these observations have led to the development of therapeutic strategies that target Apo-B for the reduction of LDL cholesterol.\nISIS 301012 or mipomersen, by ISIS Pharmaceuticals, is a second-generation 20 nucleotide antisense oligoneucleotide (ASO) which selectively inhibits apo B gene expression via RNAse H activation.  ASOs are short, deoxyribonucleotide strands which bind to the targeted mRNAs to inhibit their translation leading to their enzymatic degradation by ribonuclease (RNAse H or argonaute 2), thus inhibiting gene expression.  Phases I and II clinical trials of ISIS301012 have demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in plasma apo B levels by approximately 40% and up to 50% reduction in LDL-C with subcutaneously administered ISIS-301012 or mipomersen, even among patients with defective LDLRs.    Furthermore, a randomized phase III trial that enrolled homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients demonstrated a 15% elevation in HDL-C.  Despite its efficacy in lowering LDL-C, mipomersen did not receive approval due to a significant increase in adverse effects - injection site reactions (80-100% of patients), flu-like illness, and 3-fold elevation in liver transaminases (15%).\nThe association between thyroid hormones and cholesterol metabolism was first discovered in the 1930s, and its use as a cholesterol lowering agent has been investigated in several studies.    However, the development of thyromimetic agents was set back by the associated increase in cardiovascular events, thought to be related to contamination of the thyromimetic agent investigated with levothyroxine (LT4), as well as the discovery of statins.   The discovery of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) restored some of the investigations into thyromimetics for the reduction of LDL-C. There are two main TRs in humans:\nTR\u03b1 receptors (TR\u03b1 1 & 2). TR\u03b1 1 is predominantly in the muscles and adipose tissue; also mediates the cardiovascular responses to thyroid hormones such as tachycardia.  TR\u03b2 receptors (TR\u03b2 1 & 2). TR\u03b2 1 is mainly in the liver and it regulates cholesterol homeostasis.  Therefore, the development of TR\u03b2 1-specific thyromimetic would be a promising method of cholesterol management devoid of cardiac effects.  \nSome of the proposed mechanisms of action of these agents include:\nUpregualtion of hepatic LDLR expression by TR\u03b2.   Stimulation of bile acid synthesis through the upregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7-hydroxylase CYP7A1) Stimulation of biliary excretion (through increased expression of ATP-binding cassette proteins G5/G8 ABCG5/G8 Promotion of reverse cholesterol transport which ultimately increases the formation of HDL, enhances cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, and increases scavenger receptor B-I (SR-BI) activity for the uptake of cholesterol.\nExamples of TR\u03b2 1-specific thyromimetics that had been investigated include:\nDITPA (3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid) - terminated Eprotirome (KB2115)  by Karo Bio AB. Sobetirome (GC-1) MB07811 KB-141 T-0681\nSimilar to the statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors), inhibitors of squalene synthase prevent the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene at a point on the HMG-CoA-Mevalonate pathway which represents the commitment of cholesterol intermediates to the synthesis of cholesterol. Squalene synthase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit cholesterol production, reduce triglyceride synthesis and apoB secretion, increase LDL receptor expression and LDL uptake in HepG2 cells.  However, they are less likely to be associated with the adverse myopathic effects commonly observed with statins because they do not cause depletion of isoprenoid intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and as a result, they do not limit the prenylation or lipidation (addition of hydrophobic molecules to a protein) of membrane-directed proteins. \nTAK-475 (lapaquistat acetate) by Takeda Pharmaceuticals was the first squalene synthase inhibitor to reach phase III clinical trials for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the United States and Europe. Randomized, double-blinded, placebo and actively controlled, parallel-group studies involving TAK-475 alone and in combination with atovastatin were associated with a dose-dependent reduction of LDL-C up to 27% and 19% when compared with placebo and when combined with atovastatin, respectively in healthy human volunteers. Recent animal studies have demonstrated a protective effect against statin-induced myopathy when isoprenoid intermediates are replenished directly or by the use of TAK-475 given with high-dose statins.  Results from these studies further underscore squalene synthase inhibitors as potential drugs to clinically prevent statin-induced myopathies.\nPhase III multi-centered clinical trials are on-going to compare TAK-475 vs simvastatin alone or in combination, vs. ezetimibe, and as add-on in patients already on atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or a low or high-dose statin. It will also be investigated as add-on treatment in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nETC-1002 (8-hydroxy-2,2,14,14-tetramethylpentadecanedioic acid), by Esperion Therapeutics, is a small molecule which regulates lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. It modulates the activity of two distinct molecular targets - hepatic adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).  It works by:\nInhibition of ACL - Inhibition of adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase, an enzyme responsible for the production of ATP citrate, reduces the levels of acetyl co-enzyme A (acetyl-CoA - an important precursor to HMG-CoA which is a vital component in cholesterol and ketone synthesis). It acts on the lipid synthesis pathway upstream of HMG CoA reductase - the molecular targets of statins.  Activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMP-activated protein kinase) - AMP-activated protein kinase is a functional enzyme present in the liver, striated muscle, and the brain. It plays a key role in cellular energy homeostasis. It acts as a sensor of the energy-depleted form of ATP (i.e., AMP), and its activation results in stimulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis, inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis and lipogenesis, stimulation of skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake,  and modulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. \nIn a phase II clinical trial involving 177 patients, ETC-1002 was shown to have a dose-dependent reduction of up to 27% in LDL-C (compared with placebo) observed with the maximum dose (120mg), devoid of serious adverse effects.  This approach may represent a new target mechanism to reducing LDL-C, but additional studies are required to determine the safety due to its high possibility of producing similar adverse effects as statins.\nSterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors required in the activation of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Fatostatin, a diarylthiazole derivative, was observed to impair the activation of SREBPs, thereby decreasing the transcription of lipogenic genes in cells.  More studies are required regarding the efficacy of this potential target in reducing circulating LDL-C since it also induces the expression of PCSK9 - a serine protease which promotes degradation of LDLR, thereby preventing the clearing of LDL particles from the plasma."}

Krista\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Your stomach pain is mostly due to h.pylori induced chronic gastritis and HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). But sweating, shaking etc. can be due to gall stones. Breathing difficulty is seen in uncontrolled HERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Along with h.pylori Chat Doctor.  1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start Proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. 7. Lose weight if you are obese. 8. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. 9. Operation for gall stone is necessary if symptoms are recurrent. So consult your doctor and discuss all these."}

Sunday to attend an Army reunion in Myrtle Beach.  He has diabetes and associated problems but has been fairly healthy.  I drove on Sunday. Monday (Sept 30) he drove all morning; after having lunch he had trouble standing up & his speech was slurred.  Another patron helped me get him into the car.  It was clear that something was happening; I called 911 and an ambulance met us near Rt. 95 S at Ashland, VA and took him to Mem. Regional Med Ctr in Mechanicsville, near Richmond.  He underwent many, many tests, including MRI.  The diagnosis was probable TIA, accompanied by diabetes & hypertension.  All tests were normal for a 79 yr old man.  We asked for him to be discharged as he seemed back to normal, and we left hosp. Tuesday evening at 5 pm, arriving in Myrtle Beach about 11 pm.  On Wed (yesterday) there was another incident, with trouble walking and slurred speech, yet he was able to carry on a normal conversation.  After sleeping 2-3 hours, he was doing well--we went out with our group for the evening.  He slept well all night.  This morning, 2 hours after awakening, he again couldnt stand up and couldnt sit in his chair without slumping off.  For about 1/2 hour he could not smile on the left side; he could touch his nose with rt hand but couldnt move his left hand.  When we tried to get him into a wheelchair, he slumped down to the floor; 3 men helped him into the chair and back to our room, where he has slept for the rest of the day (about 1 pm until 7 pm; I woke him at 5:15 and he was able to sit up and walk to the bathroom with my help, then back to bed, again with my help.  I had thought that after resting, he would bounce back enough to get up and join the group, like last night.  That is not happening.  Now my concern is, should I take him to a hospital here in Myrtle Beach (I would probably need to get an ambulance to do that), have his friends help me get him into our car and drive 5-6 hours back to the hospital where they saw him Mon-Tues, try to drive him all the way home to Mass., etc.  I really dont know what is in his best interest right now.Thank you.Jeanne Johnson\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello, Your husband is having recurrent TIA, and it is almost like a completed stroke. It is a very dangerous situation and needs urgent hospitalization, treatment and investigations to find the exact cause. Treatment is done by antiplatelet therapy, statins,ACE inhibitors, anti coagulants etc. Carotid artery circulation has to be evaluated and if obstruction is found, then surgery may be done. MRI brain is required to look for any hemorrhage or infarction. Best of luckThanks"}

Biglieri, an American endocrinologist, in 1963-1966 following publication of a case report. 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting from a defect in the gene CYP17A1, which encodes for the enzyme 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase. 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Mineralocorticoid excess and lack of androgens are two main features in this disease. Mutations in the CYP17A1 gene cause 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. This gene is located on chromosome 10. 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare disease and since 2010, only 130 individuals with severe, confirmed disease had been documented. Worldwide incidence of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is low, especially compared with other forms of CAH. New cases of 17-hydroxylase deficiency continue to be reported. The most potent risk factor in the development of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is the presence of family history of 17 alpha-hydroxylase. Symptoms of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency include delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea. Patients with 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency usually appear normal. Physical examination of patients with 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is usually remarkable for gynaecomastia, hypertension, and sexual infantilism. Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency include increased deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone with low cortisol. The mainstay of therapy for 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is glucocorticoid therapy. Spironolactone and estrogen also may be used. Affected 46,XY patients require gonadectomy to prevent malignant degeneration of testes. The reconstruction surgery for ambiguous genitalia in genetically male patients may be considered."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCould you explain the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Release of CRH from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress, by blood levels of cortisol and by the sleep/wake cycle. In healthy individuals, cortisol rises rapidly after wakening, reaching a peak within 30-45 minutes. It then gradually falls over the day, rising again in late afternoon. Cortisol levels then fall in late evening, reaching a trough during the middle of the night. An abnormally flattened circadian cortisol cycle has been linked with chronic fatigue syndrome (MacHale, 1998), insomnia (Backhaus, 2004) and burnout (Pruessner, 1999).\nAnatomical connections between brain areas such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus facilitate activation of the HPA axis. Sensory information arriving at the lateral aspect of the amygdala is processed and conveyed to the central nucleus, which projects to several parts of the brain involved in responses to fear. At the hypothalamus, fear-signaling impulses activate both the sympathetic nervous system and the modulating systems of the HPA axis.\nIncreased production of cortisol mediates alarm reactions to stress, facilitating an adaptive phase of a general adaptation syndrome in which alarm reactions including the immune response are suppressed, allowing the body to attempt countermeasures.\nGlucocorticoids have many important functions, including modulation of stress reactions, but in excess they can be damaging. Atrophy of the hippocampus in humans and animals exposed to severe stress is believed to be caused by prolonged exposure to high concentrations of glucocorticoids. Deficiencies of the hippocampus may reduce the memory resources available to help a body formulate appropriate reactions to stress.\nThe HPA axis is involved in the neurobiology of mood disorders and functional illnesses, including anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, clinical depression, burnout, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome."}

Findings on CT scan suggestive of lung cancer include: \nSolitary pulmonary nodule Centrally located masses Mediastinal invasion Peripherally situated lesions invading the chest wall A ground-glass opacity Consolidation Mixed density or pure ground glass nodules Mixed density or pure ground glass consolidation\nSpiral CT perfusion study can be used as a diagnostic method for peripheral pulmonary nodules. Spiral CT perfusion study provides non-invasive method of quantitative assessment about the blood flow patterns of peripheral pulmonary nodules. Spiral CT perfusion imaging is analyzed and evaluated for:.  TDC (time density curve) Perfusion parametric maps The respective perfusion parameters. Immunohistochemical findings of microvessel density (MVD) measurement VEGF expression\nCT scans help stage the lung cancer. A CT scan of the abdomen and brain can help visualize the common sights of metastases: adrenal glands, liver, and brain. The benefits of CT Scans in lung cancer patients are the following:  Provides anatomical detail to locate the tumor Demonstrates proximity to nearby structures Deciphers whether lymph nodes are enlarged in the mediastinum\nUnfortunately, research has shown that there are a number of false positives associated with CT scanning because a CT scan on its own cannot determine malignancy.

OR There is evidence of atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region without the involvement of the entire lung. T3 Tumor > 5 cm, but \u2264 7 cm in size. AND It directly invades any of the following: chest wall (including superior sulcus tumors), diaphragm, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium. OR The tumor is localized in the main bronchus at a distance less than 2 cm distal to the carina but without the involvement of the carina.

It has a membership of over 49,000  and represents 90 percent of U.S. board-certified obstetrician-gynecologists. \nMembers are referred to as fellows and use the post-nominal letters FACOG to indicate their status. To become a fellow, candidates must pass a two-part exam given yearly. The first part is a written exam, which must be taken the first year the candidate is eligible. The second part is the oral exam, taken the year after the written exam is passed. The oral boards are based on a collection of a year's worth of cases known as the \"case list\". Many doctors feel an incredible level of stress associated with this period of time; some put their practices on hold to allow enough time to prepare adequately. Some aspects of each section of the exam change from year to year, requiring candidates to be in touch with ACOG and one another for advice and guidance.\nAn entire industry has arisen from the desire of candidates to receive coaching and review materials before testing."}

Given that treatment is palliative, patients should be given treatment holidays in order to reduce drug-induced toxicity. HER2 overexpression and hormone receptor status are very important factors that guide therapy and influence prognosis. Multiagent chemotherapy regimens don't show significant survival benefit compared to single-drug regimens and augment toxicity. Chemotherapy is recommended for patients with ER-negative metastatic breast cancer and those with ER-positive breast cancer resistant to endocrine therapy or associated with visceral disease. Trastuzumab (Her2 inhibitor) increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.  Single-agent trastuzumab is active and well tolerated as first-line treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 overexpression."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat are the natural history, predicted outcome, and potential complications that are linked with bowel syndrome?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The symptoms of short bowel syndrome usually develop immediately following bowel resection.  Short bowel syndrome may cause diarrhea which presents with massive fluid and electrolyte loss.  It is important to manage the patient following surgery, to hydrate and receive enough nutrients through parenteral or enteral routes.  Immediately after surgery, intestinal adaptation develops in three phases, including acute, adaptive and maintenance phase.  Structural, motility and functional changes occur to adapt intestine to the new situation.  Patients with remaining small bowel of more than 120 cm length, usually do not need parenteral nutrition and may be adapted easily.   It is not common for patients who have small bowel length of less than 50 to be weaned off from parenteral nutrition.   Efforts must be applied to wean the patients from parenteral nutrition to enteral nutrition and if it is possible to oral nutrition.  However, complications might happen even if all the precautions are done. \nCommon complications of short bowel syndrome may be classified to different categories, including malnutrition, surgery related, and chronic complications.         \nMalnutrition\nVitamin deficiency Vitamin A deficiency that presents with night blindness Vitamin B12 deficiency that presents with megaloblastic anemia Vitamin C deficiency that presents with bleeding tendency Vitamin D deficiency that presents with osteomalacia Vitamin E deficiency that presents with neuropathy Vitamin K deficiency that presents with bleeding Mineral deficiency Iron deficiency Folic acid deficiency Calcium deficiency Zinc deficiency Magnesium deficiency Selenium deficiency Copper deficiency Essential fatty acid deficiency\nSurgery related complications\nGeneral complications of surgery Thrombosis Hemorrhage Wound infection Postoperative pulmonary atelectasis Acute kidney injury Pulmonary embolism Deep vein thrombosis Surgery on gastrointestinal system Anastomotic disruption Anastomotic bleeding\nCatheter related complications:\nInfection of the central venous line Occlusion of the catheter due to thrombosis, fibrin formation, or precipitations Breakage of the central line\nPost bowel transplant complications:\nAcute rejection Chronic rejection Hepatic, portal, or mesenteric vein thrombosis Opportunistic infection, such as CMV, \u2026.\nChronic complications\nGastrointestinal complications Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth due to stasis Bowel obstruction Bowel motor abnormalities Stasis of intestinal contents Parenteral nutrition liver disease from steatosis to fibrosis and cirrhosis Bowel necrosis Peptic ulcers due to gastric hypersecretion Gallstones due to altered bile salt and bilirubin metabolism Hepatobiliary disease Lactose intolerance Permanent intestinal failure Extra-intestinal complications Kidney stone due to hyperoxaluria Metabolic bone disease Lactic acidosis\nThere is no definite cure for short bowel syndrome. However, medications and nutritional therapy significantly improve the quality of life and survival of the patients.  Prognosis of short bowel syndrome depends on the location and size of the bowel resection, underlying pathology, nutrition support, pharmacotherapy, and extent of intestinal adaptation.    The quality of life for patients with short bowel syndrome depends on their ability to previous activities. Majority of them on effective treatment could have an excellent quality of life.  The 2 and 5-year survival rate of patients with short bowel syndrome are approximately 80% and 70%, respectively.  The 6-year survival rate of patients with short bowel syndrome is approximately 65% for patients who have remaining short bowel of more than 50 cm.  Much hope is vested in Omegaven, a type of lipid TPN feed, in which recent case reports suggest the risk of liver disease is much lower.  Although promising, the small intestine transplant has a mixed success rate, with a postoperative mortality rate of up to 30%. One-year and 4-year survival rates are 90% and 60%, respectively."}

For the last 3 1/2 years, I have been on medication for adult ADHD that has truly transformed my life. It was at the urging of my family that I originally sought help for symptoms that I have had since childhood. I have been very stable on: Generic Concerta (methylphenidate) 54 mg ER: one each AM as well as generic Adderall 20mg each afternoon as needed. I am in need of a psychiatrist in the Van Buren county of Arkansas who would be wiling to renew the above medications. I have no allergies whatsoever. I do take generic Lipitor for a slightly high cholesterol and even though my diet is excellent and I exercise regularly, it is still necessary to have a bit of help with medication. I have no history of heart problems or problems with blood pressure and my family history is negative for that as well. I am retired and enjoying the Ozarks in close proximity to my relatives. Last week a friend and I traveled 3 hours to see a psychiatrist whose receptionist assured me should be no problem in renewing my medicines. We actually felt as if we had entered the Twilight Zone, lol. The psychiatrist insisted on seeing us both. She went into great detail regarding her medical crisis of the past year. She gave us a tour of her facility and showed us a chair that she helped invent for depression. We were shown the many gifts bestowed on her by her patients as well as pictures of her with celebrities as proof that she has been a psychiatrist to the stars in past years. After about 1 1/2 hours, she revealed that I would need to see a psychiatrist closer to my home. She offered to provide names of specialists close to me but her receptionist still has no such messages for me. She does seem like a lovely lady but it did come across as more than a bit unprofessional. Thank you in advance for helping me find a solution to my situation.

I had an ultrasound about 7 days ago to check on gallstones which were originally found 4 or 5 years ago. The ultrasound showed Cholelithiasis is demonstrated , Incidental adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder . and Borderline hepatomegaly . . The report also says The liver is at the upper limit of normal for size, right lobe measuring 15.5cm. The liver is smooth in outline and homogenous in echotexture with a normal echo pattern. No focal hepatic mass. No splenomegaly . No ascites . . Also, my liver enzymes WERE elevated around 4 Oct 2012 (AST 40 U/L, ALT 77 U/L and GGT 72 U/L) and on 3 Dec 2012 mostly back in normal range except for GGT (AST 25 U/L, ALT 35 U/L, GGT 65 U/L). I do not drink and have only had a total of two or three standard drinks in total during my lifetime. Recent STD check showed no Hepatitis STDs. Additional possibly useful info: I weighed 85 to 87 kg around March 2012 (note I was not muscular by any means), between May and July I got my weight down (intentionally with a low calorie and low/almost zero carb diet) to 68kg and have been around 68 to 70 kg since that time.

If a patient in young age (like yours) has a gallstone, surgery needs to be done. It's because sooner or later, gallstones will start to giving you the pain and can lead to acute pancreatitis.However, your liver condition is not caused by gallstones. It's rather your diet has caused both, liver problems and gallstones. And as you can see, when you improve your diet, your liver tests get back to normal. This is a very good way to help to the liver and keep it healthy. Please avoid fatty foods, fried foods, spicy foods, alcohol and painkillers. Increase vegetables, whole grains and mineral water intake and your liver will be fine. No need to worry about it. You should also have your gallbladder removed. Hope this will help. Regards."}

Since the last one, I have had some surface numbness.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Your symptoms seem to be related to a pinched nerve or nerve damage due to the surgeries. So, there is nothing to worry about. But, if this problem disturbs you, I would recommend starting clonazepam, up to 2\u00a0mg daily. You should start at a low dose 0.25\u00a0mg twice and increase slowly, in order to avoid possible adverse effects like Chat Doctor.  Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, "}

I it necessary to diagnose fibroadenosis.do I have more risk of getting breast cancer?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "A fibroadenoma is not dangerous in and of itself and surgery to remove it is optional, but you may want to have a follow-up ultrasound, MRI and/or biopsy to confirm that it is indeed a fibroadenoma and nothing more, particularly if it continues to grow. Most fibroadenomas are left in situ and monitored by a doctor, or the patient in question. Some are treated by surgical excision. They are removed with a small margin of normal breast tissue if the preoperative clinical investigations are suggestive of the diagnosis. A small amount of normal tissue must be removed in case the lesion turns out to be a phyllodes' tumor on microscopic examination. Because needle biopsy is often a reliable diagnostic investigation, some doctors may decide not to operate to remove the lesion, and instead opt for clinical follow-up to serially observe the lesion over time using clinical examination and mammography to determine the rate of growth, if any, of the lesion. A growth rate of less than sixteen percent per month in women under fifty years of age, and a growth rate of less than thirteen percent per month in women over fifty years of age have been published as safe growth rates for continued non-operative treatment and clinical observation. Some fibroadenomas respond to treatment with ormeloxifene. Fibroadenomas have not been shown to recur following complete excision or transform into followed tumors following partial or incomplete excision. Regards and take care"}

In 1847, familial adenomatous polyposis was first described.  In 1882, Cripps reported the familial nature of multiple colonic polyposis. In 1925, Lockhart-Mummery suggested an inheritance predisposition for multiple colonic polyposis. During 1930s, Cuthbert Dukes created the first register at St. Mark's Hospital in London and collected data for screening of relatives of patients with polyposis. In the 1950s, Gardner and Stephens described a syndrome with colonic and extracolonic features, including soft tissue and bone tumors which is known as Gardner's syndrome. In 1975, Bussey described the clinical characteristics and natural history of familial adenomatous polyposis.  In 1986, Herrera discovered genetic abnormality in patient with multiple colorectal polyps. In 1987, Leppert mapped gene for FAP to the long arm of chromosome 5.  In 1991, the association between mutation of the APC gene (chromosome 5 q21-22) and familial adenomatous polyposis was made."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nCan you provide a synopsis or summary of Osteosarcoma?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Bone cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor of the bone that destroys normal bone tissue. Osteosarcoma is the most common type of malignant bone cancer, accounting for 35% of primary bone malignancies. It is a malignant tumor that is characterized by the direct formation of bone or osteoid tissue by the tumor cells. Malignant tumors that begin in bone tissue are called primary bone cancer. Osteosarcoma may be classified according to the World Health Organization \u2019s histologic classification of bone tumors into three groups. The osteosarcomas may be localized at the end of the long bones (commonly in the metaphysis). Most often it affects the upper end of the tibia, humerus, or lower end of the femur. On gross pathology, areas of bone formation, hemorrhage, fibrosis, and cystic degeneration on cut surface are characteristic findings of osteosarcoma. On microscopic histopathological analysis, presence of osteoid within the tumor, pleomorphic cells, anaplastic cells, and atypical mitoses are characteristic findings of osteosarcoma. There are no established causes for osteosarcoma. The common risk factors in the development of osteosarcoma are radiation to bones, alkylating antineoplastic agents, Paget disease, multiple hereditary osteochondromas, fibrous dysplasia, Bloom syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Common complications of osteosarcoma include pathologic fracture and metastasis. The most common symptoms of osteosarcoma include bone pain that may be worse at night, swelling, and redness at the site of the tumor. On x-ray, osteosarcoma is characterized by medullary and cortical bone destruction, periosteal reaction, tumor matrix calcification, and soft tissue mass. On MRI, osteosarcoma is characterized by intermediate intensity of soft tissue and low signal intensity of ossified components on T1. High signal intensity of soft tissue and low signal intensity of ossified components on T2. The predominant therapy for osteosarcoma is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgical resection. The most common drugs used to treat osteosarcoma are cisplatin, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate."}

There is a deep hole at the lower base of my gum line.  My chin is sore all the way to the bottom.  The lesion does not appear to be as angry looking however my lip is still distorted & the pain is almost unbearable at times especially after I have tried to eat.

Follow instructions provided by your dentist. You indicate improvement. As long as this continues, do not worry. Gentle care and cleansing with warm salt water should be helpful. Anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil may assist healing by reducing your symptoms. Your dentist can prescribe a rinse known as magic mouth which may help reduce your symptoms if you need additional immediate relief with a combination of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications. Consult with an oral surgeon for a second opinion if you continue to have concerns. Monitor with follow-up visits with your dentist. Look for changes that include swelling, redness and heat that would indicate an increasing infection. There are changes that can occur such as an infection or tooth abscess, periodontal conditions or allergic reactions. Please do not panic with only two days gone by. Expect two weeks for a large ulcerated area to heal. Avoid irritants.  This can be a sensitive area for injections in the mouth. Perhaps you had local anesthetic here that can contribute to some post visit discomfort as well. Thank you for your inquiry.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family Hepadnaviridae. It is responsible for hepatitis B virus infection in humans, which attacks the liver and causes both acute and chronic disease. During HBV infection, the host's immune response causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. The HBV virion binds to a receptor at the surface of the hepatocyte and enters the cell, where it uses the host's cell mechanisms to replicate its genome and proteins. Transmission occurs from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Hepatitis B is often associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Immune complexes, such as surface antigen - antibody, are important in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B.   Hepatitis B must be differentiated from other diseases that cause fever, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, hepatomegaly, icteric sclera, elevated ALT, and/or elevated AST, such as other viral hepatitis strains, alcoholic hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis.  Generally, the highest risk for HBV infection is associated with certain lifestyles, occupations, or environments in which contact with blood from infected persons is frequent. The diagnosis of hepatitis B is made by biochemical assessment of liver function.\nIn the majority of patients with acute and chronic hepatitis B (HBV), symptoms may initially be non-specific and physical examination will be normal.  The diagnosis of hepatitis B is made by biochemical assessment of liver function. Initial laboratory evaluation usually reveals increased bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as decreased protein. Prothrombin time may be prolonged in cases of hepatocellular necrosis. Serologic markers, such as Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); anti-HBsAg; anti-HBc IgM and anti-HBc IgG; hepatitis Be antigen; and anti-HBeAg confirm the diagnosis of hepatitis B.  \nIn the majority of adult patients, the body is able to eliminate the virus without treatment. Currently, there is no treatment available for acute hepatitis B infection. Early antiviral treatment may only be required in fewer than 1% of patients with fulminant hepatitis. Treatment of chronic infection may be necessary to reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Treatment lasts between six months and a year, depending on the medication and genotype. Although none of the available drugs can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. These include the antiviral drugs Lamivudine, Adefovir, Tenofovir, Telbivudine, and Entecavir, as well as immune system modulators such as interferon alpha-2a and pegylated interferon-alpha-2a."}

Appropriate staging is important because patients with metastatic disease may receive higher total doses of radiation and extended radiation fields. Staging evaluation of central nervous system GCTs includes the following:    \nMRI of the spine and brain are essential for diagnosis, MRI also assesses extent of intracranial disease and detect metastatic disease Postoperative MRI of the brain is essential to assess residual tumor CSF cytology is used to detect malignant cells Measurement of serum and CSF tumor markers including \u03b2-hCG and AFP. Lumbar CSF should be obtained for the measurement of tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein AFP and beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin beta-HCG) and for cytopathologic review, when medically permissible. Serum tumor markers are often obtained for AFP and beta-HCG; but, they do not serve as a substitute for CSF tumor markers Evaluation of the disease outside the CNS is usually unnecessary\nGerm cell tumors, specifically germinomas, can disseminate the neuraxis at the time of diagnosis or early in the course of illness. GCTs may be disseminated throughout the neuraxis at any disease stage or at the time of diagnosis. Several unusual patterns of spread may occur in germinomas, such as subependymal dissemination in the third or lateral ventricles and parenchymal infiltration. Rarely, extracranial spread to lung and bone has also been reported. Staging of patients with bifocal intracranial germinomas limited to the suprasellar and pineal region is controversial, as some classify these tumors as localized disease and others classify such presentations as disseminated disease. There is no specific staging system which has been universally accepted for germ cell tumors, and most investigators utilize the TM system employed for staging medulloblastomas. Predominantly because of their midline location, staging for the size of the tumor at the time of diagnosis or after surgery (T-stage evaluation), has not been routinely employed in germ cell tumors.    \nM system for staging germ cell tumors is shown below in a tabular form:\nM type of germ cell tumors Features M0 M0 are those tumors without evidence of metastatic disease as determined by pre- or post diagnosis MRI of the entire brain and spine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytological examination. Patients with localized disease and negative CSF cytology are considered to be M0. M0 are considered to be metastatic negative. M1 M1 are those patients with free-floating tumor cells, which is relatively common in patients with germ cell tumors and normal spinal and brain neuroimaging finding at the time of diagnosis. Patients with positive CSF cytology or patients with drop metastasis such as spinal or cranial subarachnoid metastases that arise from intracranial lesions are considered to be M+ or metastatic-positive M2 or M3 M2 and M3 patients are those with lump disease in the spinal region or cranial subarachnoid space"}

It may be inherited as an X-linked condition, an autosomal dominant condition or as an autosomal recessive condition. Statistics are sparse, but it seems that autosomal dominant is the most common form of heredity.\nOne recent paper  quoted an incidence in males of 0.025%, or 1 in 4,000, with the female incidence being 3 to 5 times less.\nEven though mutations in the KAL-1 gene on the X chromosome can cause Kallmann syndrome, only 11-14% of patients with Kallmann syndrome have detectable KAL-1 mutations.\nAutosomal dominant mutations have been described with the FGFR-1 (8p12) gene, sometimes referred to as the KAL-2 gene. This is thought to cause about 10% of cases.\nAutosomal recessive mutations of the GnRH receptor gene (4q13.2) have also been reported.  This defect appears to produce a wider spectrum of physical symptoms than with the other gene defects, and the defect lies in the ability of the pituitary gland to recognise GnRH, rather than the ability of the hypothalamus to produce GnRH. It is debatable as to whether this is in fact Kallmann syndrome since the GnRH receptor development is not related to anosmia.\nThere may also be no obvious family history of inheritance (sporadic cases). However, it is possible for Kallmann syndrome genes to be passed on to children of a sporadic case."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the explanation of the relationship between Endoscopy and History?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The first endoscope, of a kind, was developed in 1806 by Philip Bozzini with his introduction of a \"Lichtleiter\" (light conductor) \"for the examinations of the canals and cavities of the human body\". However, the Vienna Medical Society disapproved of such curiosity. An endoscope was first introduced into a human in 1822 by William Beaumont, an army surgeon at Mackinac Island, Michigan. The use of electric light was a major step in the improvement of endoscopy. The first such lights were external. Later, smaller bulbs became available making internal light possible, for instance in a hysteroscope by Charles David in 1908. Hans Christian Jacobaeus has been given credit for early endoscopic explorations of the abdomen and the thorax with laparoscopy (1912) and thoracoscopy (1910). Laparoscopy was used in the diagnosis of liver and gallbladder disease by Heinz Kalk in the 1930s. Hope reported in 1937 on the use of laparoscopy to diagnose ectopic pregnancy. In 1944, Raoul Palmer placed his patients in the Trendelenburg position after gaseous distention of the abdomen and thus was able to reliably perform gynecologic laparoscopy.\nThe first gastrocamera was released in 1950 by Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. The device took pictures on monochromatic film using a small light bulb that was triggered manually. The device was of limited use, however, because it did not implement real-time optical capability. Olympus continued its development of endoscopes by incorporating fiber optics in the early 1960s, leading to the first useful endoscopes. In 1964, it released a gastrocamera guided by a fiberscope.  A few articles claim that Dr.Basil Hirschowitz of Univ.Of Michigan,Ann Arbor discussed the endoscope in early 50's. \nAs endoscopic technology improved, so did the methods of gastrointestinal endoscopy. Owing primarily to the efforts of Dr. Hiromi Shinya in the late 1960s, GI endoscopy developed into what is more recognizable as today's colonoscopy. While many doctors experimented with techniques to take advantage of the new iterations of endoscopes, Dr. Shinya focused on techniques that would allow for successful operation of the endoscope by an individual, rejecting the common practice at the time of utilizing two people. Consequently, many of the fundamental methods and procedures of modern colonoscopy were developed by Dr. Shinya.\nDr. Shinya's other great contribution was to therapeutic endoscopy, in his invention of the electrosurgical polypectomy snare with the aid of Olympus employee Hiroshi Ichikawa. Shinya sketched his first plans for the device on January 8, 1969. He envisioned a loop of wire attached to the end of a colonoscope that would allow for easy removal of polyps during investigation by passing a current through the wire. By September of 1969, the first polypectomy using this device was performed. Polypectomy has since become the most common therapeutic procedure performed with an endoscope. Template:Wikiref\nBy 1980, laparoscopy training was required by gynecologists to perform tubal ligation procedures and diagnostic evaluations of the pelvis. The first laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 1984 and the first video-laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987. During the 1990s, laparoscopic surgery was extended to the appendix, spleen, colon, stomach, kidney, and liver. Wireless capsule endoscopy or Capsule Endoscopy is now approved in all the countries including Japan where government reimbusement will be available from Oct.2007.Capsule Endoscopy  increases detection of Small Bowel tumors where traditional Endoscopy is not very efficient."}

Molecular genetic testing shows biallelic pathogenic variants in G6PC for patients with GSD type 1a and biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC37A4 for patients with GSD type 1b. Enzyme activity assay performed are glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic activity and glucose-6-phosphate exchanger SLC37A4 (transporter) activity.\nThe presentation of GSD type 1 may vary depending on the age of the patients. Glycogen storage disease type 1 commonly presents in infancy period (particularly age 3 - 6 months) with protruded abdomen due to hepatomegaly. Neonates presents rarely with hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis.\nPhysical examination of patients with glycogen storage disease type 1 is usually remarkable for protruding abdomen due to marked hepatomegaly, short stature, doll-like facial appearance, truncal obesity, and wasted muscles.\nLaboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of glycogen storage disease include hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia.\nThere is no ECG finding associated with glycogen storage disease type 1.\nThere is no X-ray finding associated with glycogen storage disease type 1.\nAbdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with contrast is performed to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma and should be repeated every 6 - 12 months or earlier on the basis of laboratory and clinical findings.\nRecurrent hypoglycemia causes brain damage in patients with glycogen storage disease type 1. MRI findings in glycogen storage disease type 1 due to brain damage include dilatation of occipital horns and/or hyperintensity of subcortical white matter in the occipital lobes. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography with contrast is performed to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma and repeated every 6 - 12 months or earlier on the basis of laboratory and clinical findings.\nUltrasound may be helpful in the diagnosis of glycogen storage disease type 1. Findings on an ultrasound suggestive of glycogen storage disease type 1 include hepatomegaly, increased hepatic echogenicity, and enlarged kidneys. Abdominal ultrasound should be performed at baseline and every 12-24 months to detect transformation of hepatocellular adenoma to hepatocellular carcinoma.\nDual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) may be helpful in the diagnosis of osteoporosis and/or osteopenia due to poor metabolic control in patients with glycogen storage disease type 1. Findings on an dual energy X-ray absorptiometry suggestive of osteoporosis and/or osteopenia in patients with glycogen storage disease type 1 include low bone mineral density (BMD).\nOther studies used for diasnosis of glycogen storage disease type 1 include identification of proband by either molecular genetic testing or enzyme activity assay.

That is why we recommend overweight patients, suffering from high blood pressure to try to lose weight, because it really helps. Have you lost this weight on purpose, following any diet and physical exercises or just spontaneously? If you have lost your spontaneously, I would recommend you to consult with your GP for a careful examination and perform some tests like: -routine blood test-fasting glucose-kidney and liver function tests-blood electrolytes-chest x-ray -abdominal ultrasound-inflammation tests -some cancer antigens blood tests. Sometimes a spontaneous excessive weight loss in a short period of time can be a sign of cancer or a metabolic disorder, including a thyroid dysfunction and diabetes. Hope to have been helpful!

Welcome to Chat Doctor. Com. I have read your query in detail and do understand your concern. Minoxidil is quite safe to use, and has to be used continuously for resumed benefit. The contraindications for minoxidil use are:1. If you start having irritant reaction due to minoxidil in the future, you may have to stop using it.2.  Sometimes it may cause hirsutism (unwanted hair growth) on face, etc. so you may have to stop it. Other than that, you may continue its usage for at least 6 months to tide over tenon effluvium. Take a nutritious and protein rich diet(pulses, milk products, eggs). Use of hair supplements containing biotin will be of help. Avoid routine application of gels or frequent blow Chat Doctor.

The patient swallows a barium solution, which fails to pass smoothly through the lower esophageal sphincter. An air-fluid margin is seen over the barium column due to the lack of peristalsis. Narrowing is observed at the level of the gastroesophageal junction (\"bird's beak\" or \"rat tail\" appearance of the lower esophagus). Esophageal dilation is present in varying degrees as the esophagus is gradually stretched by retained food. A five-minute timed barium swallow is useful to measure the effectiveness of treatment. Fluoroscopy can be used to demonstrate the lack of peristaltic waves in the smooth-muscle portion of the esophagus. It may also reveal \u2018vigorous\u2019 achalasia, which is characterized by random spastic contractions in the esophagus. Manometry, the key test for establishing the diagnosis. A probe measures the pressure waves in different parts of the esophagus and stomach during the act of swallowing. A thin tube is inserted through the nose, and the patient is instructed to swallow several times. Most patients should get and EGD \u2013 primarily in order to rule out malignancy (esophageal and gastric). Cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation test: CCK causes mild contraction of the LES and a more pronounced release of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the wall of the esophagus. In normal people, LES tone will decrease due to the predominant effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitters. In patients with achalasia, however, the stimulatory effect on the LES is unopposed, and LES pressure increases. Endoscopy, which provides a view inside the esophagus and stomach. A small camera is inserted through the mouth while the patient is under sedation. The endoscopist observes a \"pop\" as the scope passes through the non-relaxing lower esophageal sphincter. CT scan may be used to exclude pseudoachalasia, or achalasia symptoms resulting from a different cause, usually esophageal cancer.'"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the meaning of \"pulsus bisferiens\"?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Pulsus bisferiens is due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. Because the mitral valve leaflet doesn't get pulled into the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) until after the aortic valve opens, the initial upstroke of the arterial pulse pressure will be normal. When the mitral valve leaflet gets pushed into the LVOT, the arterial pulse will momentarily collapse and will later be followed by a second rise in the pulse pressure, as the left ventricular pressure overcomes the increased obstruction caused by the SAM of the mitral valve. This can be seen on the physical examination as a double tap upon palpation of the apical impulse and as a double pulsation upon palpation of the carotid pulse, known as pulsus bisferiens or a \" spike and dome pattern \" to the carotid pulse."}

The types of electromechanical dyssynchrony are atrioventricular, interventricular, intraventricular and intramural delay . Atrioventricular dyssynchrony results in a late diastolic ventriculoatrial gradient and so called \"pre-systolic\" mitral regurgitation. Interventricular dyssynchrony is the time delay between the contraction of the left and right ventricles and this is calculated by measuring the difference in the time of onset of systolic flow in the aortic and pulmonic valve. A time difference greater than or equal to 40 milliseconds is indicative of interventricular dyssynchrony. There are several echocardiographic techniques to measure intraventricular dyssynchrony, which include M mode echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging, tissue strain, strain rate analysis and speckle tracking echocardiography. Intramural dyssynchrony is the dyssynchrony within the myocardial wall and it has been measured using speckle tracking echocardiography . However, the most common abnormalities are prolonged atrio-ventricular and ventricular conduction, which causes regional mechanical delay within the left ventricle.\nThis mechanical delay is responsible for ventricular dyssynchrony, which can result in the following hemodynamic abnormalities :"}

These samples are far more accurate and reliable than simple sputum samples. A positive culture for TB from a bronchoscopic sample is very reliable and indicates infection with tuberculosis. The only important caveat is that the TB culture can sometimes pick up other bacteria as well. The \"AFB\" (Acid fast bacilli) culture can start growing bacteria that look like TB but are different bacteria (nontuberculous Mycobacteria).

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\n\n### Input:\ntwo years ago I had a sexual encounter with a woman I didn t know to well. During which the condom failed. I immediately stopped and replaced it. About a week later the skin on my penis became very sensitive and began to peal. I went to the Urgent care and they said it was nothing. The pealing went away, but remained sensitive. I went to my Urologist who check for STD s and I came up clean. Started having issues with urinating and went on a month of Cipro. No help from the Cipro. I then started experiencing major sweating and tingling in the groin area. To the point of having to change underwear after walking no more than 300 yards. This continues today. I have tested positive for Enteroccoculs facialis in my semen but then did a month of Amocicilian and tested negative. I have also done a month of flaygle, not sure on the spelling but anti fungal medicine. The skin on my penis, scrotum, perinium and back of thighs/buttocks continues to experience severe sweating and once that starts they feel as if they are on fire. I have seen a dermatologist but he seemed only interested in giving me different sample creams. None of which worked and a scrape was never taken. This is really taking over my life. What would you suggest I do next?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hi, The peeling of skin following your sex contact could be due to sensitization to condom itself. As long as your blood results for STD/ HIV were negative you need not bother about STD. Sweating of groin, scrotum,penis, perineum, buttock have no relation to any of the STDs. If urine contains more than 5 pus cells on laboratory investigation, it indicates infection. Otherwise, ignore the same and continue to Chat Doctor. Increased sweating and tingling may be due to your anxiety and aversion to the thought of STD. Nothing to worry. Follow your physicians' advice. "}

Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2. If she is still crying - put her in prone position and keep patting her back gently so that she passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Early detection and treatment with thyroxine (T4) does not improve important outcomes. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines recommend measurement of TSH in any individual at risk for hypothyroidism. The United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend routine screening for hypothyroid in children or adults.\nAccording to one study The cost-effectiveness of screening for mild thyroid failure compares favorably with other generally accepted preventive medical practices. Physicians should consider measuring serum TSH concentration in patients aged 35 years and older undergoing routine periodic health examinations. \nThyroid function should be measured in patients with the following:\nPituitary or hypothalamic disorders\nHistory of autoimmune diseases\nPrevious radioactive iodine therapy\nHead and neck irradiation\nFamily history of thyroid disease\nUse of medications that may impair thyroid function\nSubstantial hyperlipidemia\nHyponatremia\nHigh serum muscle enzyme concentrations\nMacrocytic anemia\nPericardial or pleural effusions\nPrevious thyroid injury\nNewer TSH assays are both more sensitive and specific than serum free T4 measurements for detecting primary hypothyroidism.Primary thyroid disorder is responsible for more than 95 percent of the cases of hypothyroidism. Therefore serum TSH is an excellent screening test for hypothyroidism than free T4 or total T4 in outpatient settings \nThere are certain situations in which measurement of serum TSH may not be a useful for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and these include Hypothalamic disease or pituitary disease,Hospitalized patients, and Patients on drugs such as amiodarone, dopamine, glucocorticoids, octreotide, metochlopramide."}

I am 50 years old, female, pre-menopausal, obese, but otherwise completely healthy, normal blood pressure, sugar levels, cholesterol, triglycerides, had hernia repair six months ago, and that was the most serious health issue of my life.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello! Thank you for the query.It's hard to answer your question not knowing what kind of hernia was repaired. If it was abdominal hernia and abdominal cavity has been opened, adhesions or hernia recurrence is possible. As you are 50 years old and obese, this makes colon cancer possible (obesity increases the risk of it). And such symptoms can be caused by large intestine issue as well. That is why I suggest you to visit your surgeon and check for possible hernia recurrence. Abdominal ultrasound should be done. No matter if the hernia is or not, you should also have colonoscopy done. Hope this will help. Regards."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nTo what is accommodation related?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Helmholtz - The most widely held theory of accommodation is that proposed by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1855. When focusing at near the circular muscle fibers of the ciliary muscle contract decreasing the equatorial circumlenticular space which reduces zonular tension and allows the lens to round up and increase in optical power lens zonules. When viewing a distance object the circular ciliary muscle fibers relax which increases the equatorial circumlenticular space causing an increase in zonular tension. The increase in zonular tension causes the surfaces of the lens to flatten and the optical power of the lens to decrease. Helmholtz\u2019s theory of accommodation is inconsistent with the well-documented flattening of the anterior peripheral surfaces of the lens and negative shift of spherical aberration that occurs during human in vivo accommodation.\nSchachar - Ronald Schachar has contributed scientific insight into the mechanism of human accommodation, indicating that focus by the human lens is associated with increased tension on the lens via the equatorial zonules. Moreover, the evidence supporting the Schachar hypothesis disproves the older theory concerning the mechanism of accommodation of von Helmholtz. Schachar found that when the ciliary muscle contracts, equatorial zonular tension is increased. The increase in equatorial zonular tension causes the central surfaces of the crystalline lens to steepen, the central thickness of the lens to increase (anterior-posterior diameter), and the peripheral surfaces of the lens to flatten. While the tension on equatorial zonules is increased during accommodation, the anterior and posterior zonules are simultaneously relaxing.  As a consequence of the changes in lens shape during human in vivo accommodation, the central optical power of the lens increases and spherical aberration of the lens shifts in the negative direction.  Because of the increased equatorial zonular tension on the lens during accommodation, the stress on the lens capsule is increased and the lens remains stable and unaffected by gravity.   The same shape changes that occur to the crystalline lens during accommodation are observed when equatorial tension is applied to any encapsulated biconvex object that encloses a minimally compressible material (volume change less than approximately 3%) and has an elliptical profile with an aspect ratio \u2264 0.6 (minor axis/major axis ratio).  Equatorial tension is very efficient when applied to biconvex objects that have a profile with an aspect ratio \u2264 0.6. Minimal equatorial tension and only a small increase in equatorial diameter causes a large increase in central curvature. This explains why the aspect ratio of a vertebrate crystalline lens can be used to predict the qualitative amplitude of accommodation of the vertebrate eye. Vertebrates that have lenses with aspect ratios \u2264 0.6 have high amplitudes of accommodation; e.g., primates and falcons, while those vertebrates with lenticular aspect ratios > 0.6 have low amplitudes of accommodation; e.g. owls and antelopes.  The decline in the amplitude of accommodation eventually results in the clinical manifestation of presbyopia; i.e., when the near focal point of the eye is more remote than the near reading distance. It has been widely suggested that the age-related decline in accommodation that leads to presbyopia occurs as a consequence of sclerosis (hardening) of the lens. However, the lens does not become sclerotic until after 40 years of age. In fact, the greatest decline in the amplitude of accommodation occurs during childhood, prior to the time that any change in hardness of the lens has been found. The decline in accommodative amplitude, rapid in childhood and slow thereafter, follows a logarithmic pattern that is similar to that of the increase in the equatorial diameter of the lens, which is the most likely basis for the accommodative loss.  As the equatorial diameter of the lens continuously increases over life, baseline zonular tension simultaneously declines. This results in a reduction in baseline ciliary muscle length that is associated with both lens growth and increasing age. Since the ciliary muscle, like all muscles, has a length-tension relationship, the maximum force the ciliary muscle can apply decreases, as its length shortens with increasing age. This is the etiology of the age-related decline in accommodative amplitude that results in presbyopia.  Any procedure that can prevent equatorial lens growth or increase the effective distance between the lens equator and the ciliary muscle can potentially increase the amplitude of accommodation. \nCatenary - D. Jackson Coleman proposes that the lens, zonule and anterior vitreous comprise a diaphragm between the anterior and vitreous chambers of the eye.  Ciliary muscle contraction initiates a pressure gradient between the vitreous and aqueous compartments that support the anterior lens shape in the mechanically reproducible state of a steep radius of curvature in the center of the lens with slight flattening of the peripheral anterior lens, i.e. the shape, in cross section, of a catenary. The anterior capsule and the zonule form a trampoline shape or hammock shaped surface that is totally reproducible depending on the circular dimensions, i.e. the diameter of the ciliary body (M\u00fceller\u2019s muscle). The ciliary body thus directs the shape like the pylons of a suspension bridge, but does not need to support an equatorial traction force to flatten the lens."}

In my opinion the delayed period in a sexually active woman gives a suspicion of pregnancy. It needs to be confirmed by doing a urine pregnancy test. Usually the urine pregnancy test gives accurate results if done a week after missed period. So you can consider doing a urine pregnancy test. The other symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period in case of pregnancy. So the delayed period, tiredness might give a suspicion of pregnancy but needs to be confirmed. Kindly consider doing a urine pregnancy test. Other tests to diagnose pregnancy are blood Chat Doctor test and ultrasound. Blood Chat Doctor test gives results well before the expected periods time i.e.., around 10 days after ovulation. Ultrasound helps in diagnosis of pregnancy around 5-6 weeks of pregnancy. Hope this helps. Best regards...."}

I can feel the bubble like sensation move and feel like a pop in my neck when I do this. I went to the doctors a few months ago with severe front neck pain when I spoke, turned my head certain ways, or swallowed, and the physician gave me some kind of muscle straining test, and with no other concerns, left it at that.

I m not really worried, but I want to know before I go for another emergency room visit if I ve done something to my neck?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello, I can understand your concern. As you are feeling the lump right under your left jaw, it is possible that you have a swollen submandibular lymph node. As it might be infected, you feel pain when you touch it. This lymph node can be infected due to presence of infection in the throat or in the oral cavity. As you are also having pain while swallowing, more chances are there of throat infection and tonsillitis. In that case, you should visit an ENT specialist to have a look at your tonsils and prescribe you antibiotics if infection is present. If the ENT specialist finds everything fine with the throat, you should consult a dentist to examine your oral cavity to find focus of infection present in the oral cavity. If infection is present in mouth like tooth decay, treatment of the infection will relieve you of pain and discomfort. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.

Digestion irregularities are associated with increased acidity in the stomach which in turn may present with foamy saliva. This is because, if whatever we eat, is not digested properly, naturally body has to produce more & more acid to digest the food we ate. Now, during sleep this acid containing fluid is being regurgitated by the patient making the throat & oral cavity sore. To compensate this soreness or irritation, large amount of saliva is produced by body to wash the mucosal lining. You should visit your dentist to evaluate the condition clinically to get the proper diagnosis as treatment will be varying depending upon it. Keep your oral cavity clean as much as you can.

Can cause either solitory or multiple abscesses  Trauma or Surgery Secondary infections may developed due to splenic trauma during any intra-abdominal procedures.  Trauma leads to hematoma formation. In case of penetrating trauma to the spleen or intraabdominal surgery, direct inoculation of the spleen with pathogens may form a septic focus which, left untreated, may lead to formation of an abscess. Immunodeficiency It is major factor involved in the course of splenic abscess especially if the causative organism is fungi or any other atypical organism.\nSolitary splenic abscess\nEnlarged spleen with due to large solitary abscesses with thick wall around the abscess to prevent dissemination is seen\nMultiple splenic abscess\nAt the time of autopsy, spleen present as large and soft, and pus extruded organ from the cut surface.\nSolitary splenic abscess\nMicroscopically the abscess consist of necrotic tissue with a fibrous wall surrounded by inflammatory cell infiltration.\nMultiple splenic abscess\nMultiple microscopically visible foci of infection riddled homogeneously throughout the spleen Abscesses are filled with polymorphonuclear leukocytes which were scattered throughout the parenchyma, intermixed with other foci of microinfarction and coagulation necrosis\nSplenic abscess is commonly associate with: \nParanchymal liver disease Pancreatitis Pleural effusion Renal cysts Ovarian cysts Abdominal lymphadenopathy"}

As per your query Bad breath after wisdom tooth removal is because of poor oral hygiene of oral cavity. After extraction due to naked socket, poor oral hygiene and pain you did not brush properly in oral cavity area due to which bacteria accumulate in oral cavity and continued accumulation leads to halitosis. Brown discharge of saliva is because of old blood clot. Need not panic about that. I would suggest you to maintain proper oral hygiene by brushing, flossing. Use antiseptic mouth wash on daily basis. Do warm saline rinses several times a day. Eat from the extraction site and try to eat crunchy food mainly. Take salivary stimulants such as sugar-free chew gums.

Chemical peeling is a simple procedure which causes controlled burning of skin leading to exfoliation superficial skin layers, decreases acne and pigmentation and gives you a rejuvenated skin. Usually post peel, redness and crusting is common and usually moisturizer and sunscreen is enough to take care the post procedure sequela. Sometimes, chemical peels may cause excessive redness/crusting due to deeper penetration of peel, but It's difficult to rule out without proper clinical examination or pictures. Anyway, start applying a cream containing demonize (Disown cream) twice a day gently over red/irritated skin followed by good quality moisturizer like Detail DAM. Always make sure you use your sunscreen before going out in sun and repeat application after every 3 hours and use proper clothing to cover face. Avoid pricking/scratching/peeling of skin. Use gentle cleanser like Detail cleanser for sensitive skin for regular face wash. Take some antihistamines like Exocet if excessive itching is there.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the diagnosis for pulmonic regurgitation using Doppler echocardiography?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Doppler echocardiography is a procedure which uses ultrasound technology to examine the heart by creating an image of it and measuring the speed and direction of blood flow. This procedure is frequently used to examine children's hearts for heart disease because there is no age or size requirement.\nContinuous generation of ultrasound waves coupled with continuous reception Two crystal transducer with dual function: one crystal devoted to generation, one for receiving Measures all velocities along transducer beam Density of signal can be compared to forward flow Shape of flow curve gives information about pressure gradient across the valve\nAdvantage: ability to measure high blood flow velocities accurately Disadvantage: lack of selectivity or depth discrimination\n\nPulse wave Doppler echocardiography has diagnostic limitations. Upon examination, as many as 87% of normal patients may appear to have pulmonic regurgitation. Length and duration of the regurgitant jet must be calculated to differentiate between true and physiologic pulmonic regurgitation. In physiologic pulmonic regurgitation the jet is < 1 cm in length and no holodiastolic in duration. The severity of pulmonic regurgitation should be further assessed via mapping techniques.\nIn this analysis, a comparison is made between the regurgitant Doppler spectral display and the pulmonic outflow Doppler spectral display. The pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure is assessed as well.\nIn this analysis, the length and width of the pulmonic regurgitation is assessed. If there is a pattern of proximal acceleration (flow convergence), this is consistent with 3+ or 4+ pulmonic regurgitation."}

Pain in coccyx is unlikely to be the presenting symptoms in colorectal cancer. However, in advanced disease such a pain might be felt. Most pain involving coccyx is because of trauma which might have occurred years back. Sometimes it can also be due to inflammation of fat around the rectal region. If the pain is severe then please get an X-ray of coccyx done. Rarely the pain in coccyx might also be due to bone involvement in prostate cancer and this requires investigation including blood test called PSA level.

At the 5' end of the RNA molecule are coded 88 nucleotides that interact, to form a clover leaf structure, which is involved in the replication process.  At the 3' end of the genome is encoded a poly Adenine sequence, which varies about 60 adenylate residues in length.  The translation of the genome is initiated by the attachment of host cell's ribosomes to the often called internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). This is a specific RNA segment in the 5' end region of the RNA (not translated), where the host cell's translational ribosomes first attach in order to initiate viral genome replication.

On June 13, 2007, FDA's Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) concluded that the French manufacturer Sanofi-Aventis failed to demonstrate the safety of rimonabant and voted against recommending the anti-obesity treatment for approval.  Subsequently, Sanofi-Aventis announced that it was withdrawing the new drug application (NDA) for rimonabant and that it would resubmit an application at some point in the future.\nOn 21 June 2006, the European Commission approved the sale of rimonabant in the then 25-member European Union. Sanofi announced that the first country in which Acomplia will be sold is the United Kingdom. Sales began in July 2006. Sanofi also announced that it projects that the drug will be sold shortly thereafter in Denmark, Ireland, Germany, Finland and Norway. It is expected in Belgium  and Sweden in 2007. Ordinary obesity will, according to official medical recommendations, not be enough to acquire the prescription in Sweden; there are additional requirements concerning abnormal blood lipid levels. \nThe EU's approval was not a blanket approval, nor did it approve Acomplia for non-obesity related problems such as smoking cessation, although off-label use of the drug is still possible. The approval is in combination with diet and exercise for the treatment of obese patients (BMI greater than or equal to 30), or overweight patients (BMI greater than 27) with associated risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia."}

It is possible that the auto accident caused a concussion injury in you. This is the mildest form of brain injury without any structural damage on imaging investigations. This takes a while to get normal and memory problems can occur. The tingling in left arm can be due to problems in the cervical spine or the brain itself. There was some evolving stroke like condition in your brain that was pre-existing. After your auto accident this further intensified probably due to stress involved. All the factors acting together caused a stroke in you."}

That last for about 5 days then it was gone. 2 weeks passed and last Friday I lost my voice again (same thing as above re whispering).

Is this bronchitis? No fever this time, as of yet. No headache or chills.\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having upper Respiratory tract infection (URI). In bronchitis inflammation of bronchi cause edema in the walls. This causes narrowing of the lumen and causes bronchospasm and wheezing (whistling sound). Thisis the characteristic feature of bronchitis.  So I don't think it is bronchitis, you must be having URI mostly pharyngitis. But better to consult doctor and get done throat and respiratory examination."}

I can understand your concern about loss of erection, inability to ejaculate hence unable to have pregnancy. Ability to have sufficient erection and ejaculation during masturbation and not with the partner suggests psychological factors playing role behind this. Occasional failure can occur to almost every man in his life. When this happens, one gets concerned about performance during next sexual encounter. He thinks whether he would be able to satisfy the partner or not. So, his mind thinks mostly about quality of erection and performance. For constant erection continuous exciting/romantic/erotic feelings should be there in mind. If mind is diverted to concern about erection (being scared in your case), you will lose erection. This in turn reduces your confidence, and it again affects the erection. Behavior therapy like Senate focus under guidance of psychiatrist will help you. Wish you good health."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the physiological process that causes atelectasis?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "It is understood that atelectasis is the result of obstructive and non-obstructive etiologies. The pathophysiology of obstructive and non-obstructive atelectasis is determined by several factors.\nObstructive atelectasis is the most common type of atelectasis Obstructive atelectasis occurs due to obstruction at any level from the trachea to the alveoli. Ventilation defect Bronchial obstruction leads to resorption of alveolar gas by the blood circulating in the alveolar capillary membrane. Alveolar gas reabsorption due to obstruction leads to diminished lung volume and subsequent atelectasis. \nPerfusion defect Perfusion of under ventilated lung tissue leads to hypoxemia due to shunt formation. leading to obstruction Following bronchial obstruction, complete collapse of the affected lung is prevented by secretions that fill up the spaces of the alveoli. The adjacent lung distends to prevent collapse of the part of the lung undergoing atelectasis. The mediastinum shifts towards the affected side. Diaphragmatic elevation of the diaphragm leads to flattening of the chest wall. The extent of atelectasis depends upon the level of obstruction. Lobar atelectasis occurs due to lobar bronchus obstruction. Segmental atelectasis arises from segmental bronchus obstruction.\nThe rate and pattern of development of atelectasis depends on collateral ventilation and gas composition of inspired air.\nNon obstructive atelectasis occurs due to severe lung scarring caused by necrotizing pneumonias or granulomatous diseases leading to cicatrisation atelectasis. Lung infiltration by a tumor (bronchoalveolar carcinoma) may cause replacement atelectasis, thoracic space occupying lesions can cause compression atelectasis, diminished levels of surfactant can lead to adhesive atelectasis presenting as ARDS. Passive atelectasis occurs due to absence of contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae due to fluid (pleural effusion), air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax) etc. Atelectasis of the upper lobe commonly occurs due to pneumothorax, whereas atelectasis of the middle and lower lobes occurs due to pleural effusion. Rounded atelectasis, which presents at a mean age of 60 years, arises due to formation of fibrous bands which adhere the lung to the pleura. There is a high association of rounded atelectasis in asbestosis due to the formation of fibrous pleural plaques.\nMiddle lobe syndrome (Fixed or recurrent atelectasis of the lingula/right middle lobe) occurs due to Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Intraluminal or extraluminal obstruction (compression of the bronchi by adjacent structures) results in middle lobe syndrome.   Patients with lower respiratory tract infections, PE and hypoventilation may develop obstruction of the small bronchus, leading to formation of small atelectatic areas within the lung. This may be due to respiratory stressors such as toxins, hyperoxia, hypoxia, ischemia leading to impaired surfactant production and impaired regional ventilation. Intrapulomary shunt formation and ventilation perfusion mismatch may arise to due to development of this platelike atelectasis. Patients undergoing upper abdominal and thoracic procedures may develop postoperative atelectasis which may arise as a complication of surgery or anaesthesia leading to decreased surfactant activity and dysfunction of the diaphragm. Postoperative atelectasis is segmental and basilar in distribution."}

I had many tests done last year and nothing was conclusive. The morning is the worst. I wake up at almost the same time everyday - between 3 and 5 am - with pain and get some relief when I go to the bathroom. The doctor thinks I have the stomach flu and the stress is a factor. I did some research and Pancreatitis fits my symptoms. My Triglycerides arent high (152) but my LDL is 181. Also my WBC has been a little elevated for several years (14.1). My doctor started me on Lovastatin for my high cholesterol, but it caused my stomach symptoms to be worse, so she said to stop taking it. Im not sure what to do and fear that no one takes me seriously because I suffer from OCD which exaggerates the symptoms at times. Could it be Pancreatitis?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "HI. Thanks for an elucidated history and I have understood your problems well. Very true that the symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea and fatty stools can fit into a clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis. The other factors which can be contributory are: Backache at the place where the pancreas is. Jaundice in some cases, pain is always in an upper abdomen and deep-rooted. There may not be fever. The other probable causes can be IBS, stress, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal cancer and so on. I would advise you the following:MRCP and ERCP can really help in a diagnosis. Liver function tests. Blood amylase and lipase for pancreatitis Blood sugar, urea, creatinine, electrolytes and so on. Stool examination - indication of pancreatitis Eminence the diagnosis is made it becomes easy to manage a case. It is good that your Lovastatin is stopped as it was causing a problem. Take Fat free diet, multivitamins, Pancreatic enzyme supplements."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat role does surgery play in the treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma depends on the following features:\nStage of the tumor Regional or distant metastatic disease. Surgery is best reserved for patients with small tumors located in the sinonasal cavity without involvement of the orbit or skull base. For more advanced tumors, the successful treatment includes surgery and radiation therapy with most of the institutions favoring delivery of postoperative, rather than preoperative, radiotherapy. Large and bulky tumors (T3 and T4) are treated with preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by surgery. The optimal treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma includes complete surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiation therapy. However, some institutions have reported success with alternative treatment modalities, including surgery without radiation.\nDulguerov\u2019s 2001 meta-analysis showed lower recurrence rates for the combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The literature gives little support to single-modality treatments; only few studies have advocated either radiation or surgery alone.  Some institutions advocate surgery alone for Kadish stage A tumors, whereas the majority suggest adjuvant radiotherapy for these lesions.\nThe traditional surgical approach for esthesioneuroblastoma, is craniofacial resection (CFR). Craniofacial resection is a combined transcranial and transfacial approach, which includes a lateral rhinotomy or midfacial degloving and frontal craniotomy. The objective of this approach is to achieve an en bloc resection of tumor and involved structures. It also involves removal of the olfactory bulbs, cribriform plate, roof of the ethmoid sinuses, upper septum, medial maxillae, and as much of the anterior cranial fossa dura as necessary. The advent of craniofacial resection is credited with increase in overall survival for esthesioneuroblastoma patients. The postoperative morbidity (approximately 35%) and mortality (2-5%) with craniofacial resection is relatively high, although the complication rate associated with craniofacial resection has decreased over the last few decades.\nAlthough traditional craniofacial resection remains the gold standard, less invasive endoscopic techniques have become increasingly utilized. Minimally invasive endoscopic resection (MIER) is a complete endoscopic approach, most suited for tumors that have not invaded the brain tissue. Endoscopic-assisted cranionasal resection (EA-CNR) combines transnasal endoscopic approach with craniotomy and addresses large tumors that have invaded brain tissue. There are distinct advantages of EA-CNR and MIER over traditional CFR. Endoscopic techniques allow great access to anatomic areas where external approaches are notoriously known to fail, such as frontal recess and the sphenoid sinus region. The endoscope plays an important role in tumor surveillance, in the postoperative period. Finally, the endoscopic approach eliminates the need for disfiguring facial incisions. Endoscopic techniques have shown to have comparable success rates but fewer complications compared with traditional craniofacial resection."}

The chapter on Primary PCI can be found here.\nStated simply, this is performance of a PCI in a closed artery following fibrinolytic therapy. Rescue PCI is defined as the intent to administer a fibrinolytic agent in the setting of STEMI, and the performance of PCI for failure of the fibrinolytic agents is unintended. If there are clinical signs and symptoms of failure of the fibrinolytic agent to achieve reperfusion, then rescue PCI is performed to open the totally occluded artery. The strategy differs from facilitated PCI, a strategy in which the intent is to administer a fibrinolytic agent, and routinely perform PCI in the majority of patients even in the presence of or irrespective of signs and symptoms of successful fibrinolytic reperfusion. The chapter on Rescue PCI can be found here.\nStated simply, this is performance of a PCI in an open artery following fibrinolytic therapy. Adjunctive PCI is defined as the intent to administer fibrinolytic agent in the setting of STEMI, and the performance of PCI for partial success of the fibrinolytic agent is unintended. If there are clinical signs and symptoms of incomplete reperfusion, then adjunctive PCI is performed to further open a patent artery (one with TIMI grade 2 or 3 flow). The strategy differs from facilitated PCI in that the intent is to administer a fibrinolytic agent, and the performance of PCI is intended to improve the fibrinolytic results."}

In treating advanced diabetic retinopathy, the burns are used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels that form at the back of the eye.\nBefore the surgery, the ophthalmologist dilates the pupil and applies anesthetic drops to numb the eye. In some cases, the doctor also may numb the area behind the eye to prevent any discomfort. The lights in the office are also dimmed to aid in dilating the pupil. The patient sits facing the laser machine while the doctor holds a special lens to the eye. The physician can use a single spot laser or a pattern scan laser for two dimensional patterns such as squares, rings and arcs. During the procedure, the patient may see flashes of light. These flashes may eventually create an uncomfortable stinging sensation for the patient. After the laser treatment, patients should be advised not to drive for a few hours while the pupils are still dilated. Vision may remain a little blurry for the rest of the day, though there should not be much pain in the eye.\nRather than focus the light on a single spot, the eye care professional may make hundreds of small laser burns away from the center of the retina, a procedure called scatter laser treatment or panretinal photocoagulation. The treatment shrinks the abnormal blood vessels. Patients may lose some of their peripheral vision after this surgery, but the procedure saves the rest of the patient's sight. Laser surgery may also slightly reduce color and night vision.\nA person with proliferative retinopathy will always be at risk for new bleeding as well as glaucoma, a complication from the new blood vessels. This means that multiple treatments may be required to protect vision.\nInstead of laser surgery, some people need an eye operation called a vitrectomy to restore vision. A vitrectomy is performed when there is a lot of blood in the vitreous. It involves removing the cloudy vitreous and replacing it with a saline solution made up of salt and water. Because the vitreous is mostly water, there should be no change between the saline solution and the normal vitreous.\nStudies show that people who have a vitrectomy soon after a large hemorrhage are more likely to protect their vision than someone who waits to have the operation. Early vitrectomy is especially effective in people with insulin-dependent diabetes, who may be at greater risk of blindness from a hemorrhage into the eye.\nVitrectomy is often done under local anesthesia. The doctor makes a tiny incision in the sclera, or white of the eye. Next, a small instrument is placed into the eye to remove the vitreous and insert the saline solution into the eye.\nPatients may be able to return home soon after the vitrectomy, or may be asked to stay in the hospital overnight. After the operation, the eye will be red and sensitive, and patients usually need to wear an eyepatch for a few days or weeks to protect the eye. Medicated eye drops are also prescribed to protect against infection."}

Hepcidin blocks ferroportin from releasing iron from the body stores. Inflammatory cytokines also decrease ferroportin expression and stops erythropoiesis by increasing bone marrow erythropoietin resistance.

Therefore, the upregulation of white blood cells causes fewer stem cells to differentiate into red blood cells. This may also have a role in inhibition of erythropoiesis,even when erythropoietin levels are normal, and aside from the effects of hepcidin."}

Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually livedo reticularis), gangrene of the extremities and sometimes renal failure; problems with other organs may arise, depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream.  When the kidneys are involved, the disease is referred to as atheroembolic renal disease (AERD).  The diagnosis usually involves biopsy (removing a tissue sample) from an affected organ. Cholesterol embolism is treated by removing the cause and with supportive therapy; statin drugs have been found to improve the prognosis.  CES is underdiagnosed and may mimic other diseases."}

For now, you should go with what the physician guides you, may be a diuretic will be prescribed and maybe they can ask you to reduce or stop completely the painkillers if they suspect the kidney is getting malfunction.

Today i am experiencing sharp stabbing pain in my upper right abdomen and have been having bowels that are yellow oily liquid. Also my hands are swollen.

ALCOHOL is totally prohibited in your case. Alcohol consumption can affect the liver could also cause pain in the area of the bile tract, or in the liver itself. Abdominal pain is not easy to diagnose, especially for a lay person, so you should not simply assume that you have a gall bladder problem. Apart from the location of the pain, there are several factors that are taken into consideration when diagnosing abdominal pain. Alcohol can also cause fluid retention in your hands and feet, also known as peripheral or dependent edema leading to swelling. Since this pain seems to develop after consumption of alcohol, it could originate in the stomach itself. You may be suffering from stomach ulcers or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), which is being aggravated by the alcohol consumption. It is important that you do not neglect this problem.  I hope this will help Best wishes"}

In fact many studies show that they reduce blood pressure. There are 3 possibilities to your recent rise in blood pressure1. A new onset renal failure either due to HIV or blood clots in your renal artery or vein. You will need to do bloods for creatinine and urinalysis and also Doppler of renal artery and vein.2. There could be a new valvular heart problem that comes with age called aortic stenosis, so you will need to evaluated by physician for the same. He/She may want to do Echocardiography for the same.3.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nWhat is the historical background or context of Alopecia?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "The term alopecia (al-oh-PEE-she-uh) was used by physicians dating back to Hippocrates alopecia and is formed from the Greek \u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7\u03be (alopex), meaning fox. The origin of this usage is because this animal sheds its coat twice a year.  The first use of the phrase alopecia areata is attributed to Polish physician John Jonston (1603\u20131675) in his book \u201cMedicina Practica,\u201d written in 1664. The term alopecia areata. (AA) was introduced by French physician Sauvages de Lacroix (1706\u20131767) in \u201cNosologia Methodica,\u201d published in 1763.  The term bald probably comes from the word ball, a Celtic word which means \"white patch\" such as is sometimes seen on a horse's head or the old English word balde, which means \"white or pale\". \nMinoxidil was initially produced for the management of refractory hypertension in the 1970s.  The effect of minoxidil on hair growth was first identified by Guinter Kahn. He observed and report hair growth on patients who were on the minoxidil patch and postulated their possible use for hair growth. Julianne Imperato-McGinley discovered smaller prostates and the absence of male patterned baldness in Caribbean males with a deficiency of 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme required in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. These discoveries subsequently culminated into the development of finasteride, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.    In 1897, Menahem Hodara succeeded in using scalp tissue harvested along with its intact blood supply from an unaffected region of the scalp to treat an area of the scalp scarred by favus. The foundations of the modern methods used in hair transplantation originated in the 1930s,  where Japanese surgeons replaced patchy regions of eyebrows or eyelashes using small grafts. However, this was not to treat baldness. Norman Orentreich pioneered the modern age of hair transplantation in the 1950s by successfully transplanting large amounts of hair. He experimented with using free donor grafts in the treatment of patients with male pattern baldness. The initial school of thought at that time was that hair transferred to an area affected by alopecia would do no better than the hair it replaced. However, Orentreich proved that the grafts were \"donor dominant,\" by showing that the transferred hairs thrived just as they would have at their previous location. \nThe world is more accepting to men with baldness than women. In most parts of the world, baldness is considered to be less desirable and acceptable. However, majority of males and females with hair loss feel less desirable as a result of it. \nThere are several famous people who are who have shaved heads including former soccer players and current soccer managers Pep Guardiola and Zinedine Zidane, former basketball player Michael Jordan and actors such as Bruce Willis, Vin Diesel, and Jason Statham."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAnswer this question truthfully\n\n### Input:\nHow does Nitrendipine work?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Once Nitrendipine is ingested, it is absorbed by the gut and metabolized by the liver before it goes into the systemic circulation and reaches the cells of the smooth muscles and cardiac muscle cells. It binds more effectively with L-type calcium channels in smooth muscle cells because of its lower resting membrane potential.  The Nitrendipine diffuses into the membrane and binds to its high affinity binding site on the inactivated L-type calcium channel that\u2019s located in between each of the 4 intermembrane components of the \u03b11 subunit . The exact mechanism of action of Nitrendipine is unknown, but it is believed to have important tyrosine and threonine residues in its binding pocket and its binding interferes with the voltage sensor and gating mechanism of the channel . Thought to have a domain-interface model of binding. In hypertension, the binding of Nitrendipine causes a decrease in the probability of open L-type calcium channels and reduces the influx of calcium. The reduced levels of calcium prevent smooth muscle contraction within these muscle cells. Prevention of muscle contraction enables smooth muscle dilation. Dilation of the vasculature reduces total peripheral resistance, which decreases the workload on the heart and prevents scarring of the heart or heart failure."}

What can be the.cause?\n\n### Response:\n", "completion": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Pain in arm pit can be due to painful lymph node or musculoskeletal pain. Presence of lump in the arm pit is suggestive of lymph node. Clinical assessment and aspiration cytology of the lump is required. Consult your primary healthcare provider for clinical assessment. In aspiration, cells are aspirated from the lump, spread on a slide and stained with appropriate stains. These cells are examined microscopically to know the nature of the lesion. Treatment will be decided after receiving the result of investigation. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "}

You may only need oxygen and rest. The health care provider may use a needle to pull the extra air out from around the lung so it can expand more fully. You may be allowed to go home if you live near the hospital.\nIf you have a large pneumothorax, a chest tube will be placed between the ribs into the space around the lungs to help drain the air and allows the lung to re-expand.\nThe chest tube can be left in place for several days. You must stay in the hospital while the chest tube is in place.\nSome patients with a collapsed lung need extra oxygen, which helps the air around the lung be reabsorbed more quickly.\nLung surgery may be needed to treat your pneumothorax or to prevent future episodes. The area where the leak occurred may be repaired. Sometimes, a special chemical is placed into the area of the collapsed lung. This chemical causes a scar to form."}

These habits include the frequently washing hands, avoiding contact with infected person's bodily fluids, avoiding the potential sharing of items that have come in contact with saliva or other bodily fluids of infected individuals including beverages, food utensils, and food. Avoiding the kissing of infected individuals. Engaging in safe sexual relations. \nIndividuals should avoid close contact or prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments. Individuals who anticipate possible prolonged exposure to TB, such as medical staff, individuals in prison, or homeless shelter populations should have a tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test before leaving the United States. \nIndividuals should practice proper safety procedures to reduce the risk of eye damage when engaging in potentially damaging activities. Proper hygiene for post-surgical practices must be implemented after any ocular, surgical procedures. Proper hygiene should be practiced for individuals using contact lenses. \nOcular syphilis is a result of a Treponema pallidum infection (syphilis) and therefore may be prevented through preventing a syphilitic infection. Syphilis is best prevented through abstinence. Reducing the risk of a syphilitic infection may be achieved with the proper implementation of prophylactic intercourse strategies. \nToxoplasmosis may be prevented by wearing gloves when gardening and the proper implementation of highly-effective hygienic habits prior to eating or drinking. Individuals should vigorously wash their hands after coming in contact with any raw meats as well as the utensils used in the preparation of the meat. Meat should be cooked thoroughly prior to consumption. Individuals should practice proper hygienic procedures when handling cats and other potentially infected domestic/ wild animals."}

The pathogenesis of dumping syndrome varies according to the etiology but the most essential component is the rapid gastric emptying. The exact cause is not yet concluded, although several known phenomena may contribute to the development of early dumping symptoms.  \nThe main pathogenesis can be subdivided into the following:\nAccelerated gastric emptying Reduced gastric volume\nAlteration of the pyloric muscle that holds the gastric contents till complete digestion, leads to a rapid transit of gastric contents into the small intestine. This rapid descent of partially digested food into the intestines causes an osmotic shift of fluids from the extracellular compartment leading to hypotension which leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system Reactive hypoglycemia occurs secondary to hyperinsulinemia caused by high concentration of carbohydrates in the proximal small intestine and rapid absorption of glucose (late dumping)  \nRemoval of a part of the stomach and small intestine causes the food to bypass the stomach and rapidly descent through to the ileum or jejunum which may lead to osmotic shifting \nDumping syndrome is most common in patients with certain types of stomach surgery, such as a gastrectomy or gastric bypass surgery, that allow the stomach to empty rapidly. Dumping syndrome can also occur as a result of complications after a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) \nPatients with esophageal cancer who undergo esophagectomy to remove the cancerous portion of their esophagus are also at an increased risk of developing dumping syndrome. The stomach is pulled into the chest and attached to what remains of the esophagus, leaving a short digestive tract \nSurgery is one of the major causes leading to a reduced gastric volume. The following mechanisms lead to the development of dumping syndrome post surgery: \nChanges that affect the storage of food in the stomach or the alteration and manipulation of the pyloric muscle cuase delivery of hyperosmolar material into the intestine. Fluid shifts cause rapid small bowel distention and an increased peristalsis (early dumping) Supraphysiologic release of gastrointestinal peptides / vasoactive mediators lead to paradoxical vasodilation in a relatively volume-contracted state Removal of a part of the stomach can cause the contents to not digest and flow down undigested. This leads to a large hyperosmolar load entering into the intestines. This hyperosmolar chyme leads to an osmotic shift of fluids from the vascular compartment to the intestinal lumen. The major sequelae of this is hypotension and activation of the sympathetic nervous system Pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia, rather than late dumping, is thought to be the underlying mechanism for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with nesidioblastosis after gastric bypass. These patients do not respond to treatment for dumping syndrome, and it is difficult to confirm this rare diagnosis. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of late hypoglycemia after gastric bypass\nThe following are hormonal changes occur in dumping syndrome:      \nThe following are effects caused by specific hormones:\nThe following illustraion outlines the major events involved in the pathogenesis of dumping syndrome (early and late):  \n\nThere are a few diseases that have a different mechanism compared to conventional risk factors such as surgery leading to dumping syndrome. The following are the diseases:\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome: A rare disorder involving extreme peptic ulcer disease and gastrin-secreting tumor s in the pancreas, may also have dumping syndrome\nConnective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Can experience \"late\" dumping as a result of decreased motility.\nLow blood sugar, or hypoglycemia: Because the rapid \"dumping\" of food triggers the pancreas to release excessive amounts of insulin into the bloodstream. This type of hypoglycemia is referred to as \" alimentary hypoglycemia \". Diabetes: Neuropathy can cause damage to the nerves supplying the GIT"}

This leads to stool-withholding. A vicious circle ensues.\nThe rectum becomes gradually distended with accumulated stool. The distension causes a loss of sensation in the rectum. This leads to further stool-withholding, as the urge to defecate becomes more and more irregular.\nEventually, softer stools from higher up the bowels cannot be accommodated and leak around the bolus of hard stool (overflow). Due to the lack of rectal sensation, this is not noticed by the child until soiling has actually occurred.\nParents are under great stress, as they might think or suspect that their child is soiling intentionally and become irritated and even aggressive. They might have also been advised that their child is psychologically abnormal, which leads to further distress.\nBoth parents and child often suffer great psychological abuse. Soiling can result in a disruption of relationship between the parents as well as the parents and their child.\nChildren who soil then become very frightened as they are punished for something over which they have no control.

Since you have many issues (old and newer ones) there should be proper monitoring under experts. I would suggest you make a diary and note your symptoms for spine and related disease in separate chronological order and group your other cardiac or related events in a separate sequence and make a third group of additional symptoms in chronological order. Likewise, treatment taken in past and present symptoms' treatment separately. This will give a clearer view of what needs priority attention and supportive treatment for acute and chronic problems. A check-up with spine specialist to sort your disc related problem, if your physical conditions allow objectively, then some surgical treatment for spine may be indicated."}
